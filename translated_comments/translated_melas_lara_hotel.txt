1. Yorum: One of the worst hotels I've ever been to. The food is not good, always cold and tasteless. The waiters are a disaster. You get up to look for another plate and they take everything off the table as if you had finished eating. Whether food is available 24 hours a day is questionable. You only have the restaurant that opens for breakfast, lunch and dinner and a bar in the hotel lobby that has some desserts. That alone. The rooms are cleaned, in my case after midday, since the hotel is not full, I don't want to imagine it being in the middle of the season. Visit All Inclusive in Mexico, Cuba and Egypt. This is well below the minimum expected. I would not recommend it, and I will even make the same suggestion to my travel agency, since they offered me this hotel. 2. Yorum: My partner and I stayed there for 2 days. We fell short! The hotel is super modern, with very spacious and bright rooms. The hotel facilities are very nice and cozy. We didn't have good weather, as it rained both days,‚Ä¶ 3. Yorum: Very spacious rooms and the best of all is the food, everything you try is delicious, the beach is beautiful and if you have time, don't miss going to the center of Antalya to see it. There is Wi-Fi with a good password and the drinks are good. 4. Yorum: Super friendly staff. Everything very clean. And I have visited many hotels in this country. 5. Yorum: Great beach, good service, food and room. 6. Yorum: Very good hotel. Friendly staff. 7. Yorum: From the moment we entered the hotel we felt like we were on vacation. The offer to have lunch until our room was ready and then the niceties like "Don't wait, I'll come to you immediately with information"‚Ä¶ 8. Yorum: We have a lot of fun here. It is ideal for families. It is very quiet and you can relax. The employees are extremely friendly and not at all obnoxious. The food selection was amazing. I'm going home with 5 kilos. The pool was very clean and there were plenty of sun loungers. 9. Yorum: We stayed 2 people for 4 nights and 5 days between September 12th and 16th. Normally I would not have booked this hotel but Jolly Tour said they would direct us to Melas Hotel and you cancelled our booking at the last minute. Everything's fine. We really liked the hotel, its friendly staff and cleanliness. The rooms are cleaned every day, I would especially like to thank the cleaning staff. The service was fast, we loved the Turkish night food, there was a great variety of alcohol, by the way, and the waiters did not discriminate between Turks and foreigners, and I really liked the a la carte food, it was free. one day. The pool was clean, the sea wavy and deep, but the section of sun loungers was quite large. There were entertainment shows every day, the name of the chef of the mini club Selin, if I'm not mistaken, was very sincere, but the other 2,3 entertainers have a distinction between Germans and Turks, I understand you too, but no way. I would like to thank Mr. Mehmet at the reception for his smile and the room he provided us. I took a photo, thanks Emirhan, it's worth taking a photo with the view. However, I understand what the hotel staff are saying, the market and the hair salon will be expensive, but there is no need to be arrogant. 10. Yorum: The hotel was really great! Everything was clean, good service and very good food.üëç Large well kept outdoor area.||Continuous sound of other hotels from left and right. üôÑ Sometimes until late at night. But the hotel doesn't‚Ä¶ 11. Yorum: The hotel is very suitable for a holiday with small and medium-sized children. The room, the food, the pool, the beach, the sea and everything is great. Well maintained, very tasty, very clean and great fun for everyone. This is our second time here and we will definitely be back. 12. Yorum: Five stars are not enough. It is true that the hotel is a bit old, at least the furniture. We had a newly renovated bathroom with shower. Thank God it's not as big a box as the one around it. You immediately feel comfortable and very welcome. Due to the size of the hotel, you will be able to find your way around very quickly. Everything is very well maintained. There is always cleaning somewhere. The staff is everywhere at the same time. We have never experienced such fast, perfect and friendly service anywhere in the world. You always have a contact person if needed. The interior of the hotel is very quiet. Outside there is only noise. Events remain within limits. Don't expect too much action. We thought it was very good, as did our long-time regular customers. There is also one every night. A show that changes weekly takes place. The hotel is ideal for people who enjoy beach and bathing culture and would like to eat and drink plenty of good food. If you want to do something, you should book the various excursions. The numerous photographs of the guests are very significant. There is nothing to add. 13. Yorum: The hotel's proximity to the airport, just a 20-minute drive, made it incredibly convenient. As soon as we walked in, we felt welcome. The reception staff offered us a drink and brought our check-in documents directly to our seats, without the need to queue at reception. Our room was clean and the next day a little surprise awaited us: small flowers carefully placed on our beds by the cleaning staff. Additionally, the room had a safe for our valuables. The hotel has a nice garden that leads directly to the beach. From time to time, you will find friendly kittens in the garden. My son had brought cat treats from our home country and the cats seemed to enjoy this new treat. These resident felines have their own little house and receive care from the hotel. For beach lovers, there is always seating available and volleyball games start around 11:00 for those looking for extra fun. The sea is crystal clear and the beach bar ensures that you will never be short of refreshments and snacks. The pool bar also offers a variety of delicacies and snacks. Wherever we went, we saw cleaning staff everywhere, working diligently despite the heat. They were always serving and assisting the guests. The restaurant's varied menu catered to all tastes, with different themes at each meal. The meat dishes were always tender and delicious. With many options available, there was something for everyone. The children's entertainment team kept my son entertained and the evening program was enjoyable. While the Turkish show was decent, I was hoping for some improvement. On the other hand, the Mongolian show exceeded expectations. On Sundays the animation team usually has the day off, which is understandable. However, we were a little bored without activities on Sunday. The photographer took some good photos of us, although he was a bit pushy about selling us all the photos he took. In short, I highly recommend this hotel! 14. Yorum: We were here in early October 2024. The hotel reception was very friendly and helpful. They took our bags immediately. Drinks and snacks were immediately available. Our room was spacious. The extra bed was very comfortable. Pool towels were available in the room and could be changed daily. The buffet was always very extensive and everyone could find something. The quality of the food was very good. All facilities were very clean and well maintained, the staff was always very friendly and helpful. The kids club was excellent - Selin in particular took excellent care of the children and was very responsive to their needs and wishes. There were daily participation offers for everyone, but they were not offered in an intrusive manner. In the evening there was a children's disco and then a daily show. We had a fantastic stay here and would love to return. 15. Yorum: Overall it was a nice and quiet stay. You shouldn't expect animation. In my opinion, the hotel is more geared towards retirees. Although there were many families, for the price this hotel charges there are much better hotels where children have more opportunities to spend their time. 16. Yorum: We were there for the first time and we have been back since yesterday. We were very excited. Not far from the airport, everything went well. Great staff who are very friendly and helpful. Great buffet and something for everyone. Clean, quiet and comfortable hotel complex. I would love to go back 17. Yorum: We spent a week in this hotel. I rate the hotel as very good. It met expectations in every aspect. High-level service from the first moment. The rooms were very clean and tidy, they were cleaned every day. Beautiful view from the room. The food was very good and varied at every step and every hour from morning to night. Great service at the bars. The waiter Erkan deserves special attention. A cheerful, always helpful man who greets us every day with a smile and kind words. Furthermore, all the services at this hotel are of a very high standard, but it would be difficult to remember all the names. The hotel is mainly aimed at guests from Germany, which is a big plus because it is not noisy and is full of culture. The pool is large, there are plenty of sun loungers at any given time and you can find something to do on the beach. You don't have to fly out in the morning to get something done. The entire hotel is very clean and very well maintained. With a clear conscience, I recommend it to anyone who wants to truly relax. I might go back there next year. Thank you Melas Lara for a wonderful holiday. 18. Yorum: The hotel is a bit old. However, you can't complain about cleanliness or anything else. The staff is super friendly and helpful, you feel in good hands. The food, at any time, leaves nothing to be desired. It's our first time there and we are more than satisfied. From small to large, it's great for everyone. In any case, highly recommended. 19. Yorum: We are regular guests at Melas Lara. Anyone who really values ‚Äã‚Äãa relaxing holiday with good food and excellent service will be more than satisfied with this hotel. The buffet offers a wide selection of high quality dishes. The poolside and beach bars serve fresh food. At the beach bar we can highlight Ebru. A very warm and above all attentive waitress. We feel very comfortable with her. Very polite, always with a smile on his face. As soon as the glass is empty, he brings you a new one: perfect service. But we can really praise all the employees. Whether it's reception, service staff, room service, bellhops, housekeeping, cooks. Everyone goes out of their way to ensure you have a perfect holiday, everyone has a smile on their face. Many thanks to the whole team! 20. Yorum: I am currently a guest at the hotel and am commenting as a tourist and would never give empty praise. This place is wonderful‚Ä¶ I mean, I‚Äôve been to many hotels, including Rixos, and I can say that it‚Äôs one of the few hotels where guest satisfaction is given such a high priority. There is no discrimination between Turks and foreigners, on the contrary, they are much more helpful. The reception is extremely professional, the rooms are spotlessly clean, the quality of the food is legendary, everything we put on our plate is extremely delicious and the variety of red meats and chicken is sufficient. Their cheese blew me away. Selman at the restaurant, Mrs. Zeynep at the lobby bar and Ali at the pool bar are extremely friendly and helpful. And Meri√ßhan! Your bartender who prepared the best cocktail I have ever tasted in my life‚Ä¶. Wowwww Recipes must be preserved, please. Preferred again and again. 21. Yorum: We were here the last week of August! Quite nice hotel, excellent cuisine! It's a very hot year, so the sea water doesn't cool down anymore, but you accept it and can't do anything about it. Mother and sister had some kind of bacterial poisoning and now you're getting angry. The private hospital with which the hotel collaborates charges for transportation to and from the hospital. A serum 200 euros and the control 165 euros. But it was our fault. Because we could have gone to a cheaper hospital with a taxi and doubled the distance and costs. 22. Yorum: We were there for the first time. The hotel is not far from the airport, so the trip is not long. The hotel is a bit old, you can tell by the outdated rooms. He could use some refreshment. But everything is in very good condition. Like the whole installation! The staff is very helpful and friendly. You can say that all wishes will come true. The pools are sufficiently available and clean, but some individual tiles could be put back in place. Nothing bad, no risk of injury, etc. Pool values ‚Äã‚Äãare checked periodically to ensure that the water always remains optimal. There is food everywhere‚Ä¶literally. It tastes good, it is fresh and delicious. Breakfast and dinner are gigantic. There is something for everyone, you are sure to find what you are looking for. We can only recommend the hotel. The location of the beach is great. We will return. 23. Yorum: Lovely hotel, very clean, good rooms. Rooms with bathroom are not suitable for elderly people. Good food but I miss the fresh and different juices. There are too many sun loungers next to each other at the pool, no showers to rinse off and the music is too loud. Also, a good hotel to get away for a while. 24. Yorum: I had a great time staying here with my family from May 6th to 13th. The hotel room was huge, with a fabulous balcony terrace where my little one loved to run around with all that space available. There are many options with food and they get better every day. The facilities were great and it was a lovely walk to the beach. The only negative experience was that I must have had a minimum of 12 sittings for lunch and dinner with my wife and not once were we offered or asked if we wanted refills on our drinks or coffee, when other guests were asked. I had to go alone to get drinks for the table. One of the chefs also denied me food for some reason, when I paid for the all-inclusive options. The night waiters might be more attentive if you are not of European origin. However, it is a lovely hotel and overall I enjoyed my stay. 25. Yorum: Very nice hotel not too big. Super delicious food üòã The staff is always friendly and helpful. Rooms always clean, no damage or anything like that. The sea is clean. The beach is cleaned and cleaned daily. The facilities are very well maintained. I have been here twice and super satisfied üòÄ 26. Yorum: The hotel is not as big as some of the bunkers in Lara Beach, with about 320 rooms. Large size. Very, very nice and attentive staff, incredibly good buffet, great variety and prepared with great care. The rooms are‚Ä¶ 27. Yorum: The staff was incredibly attentive and friendly to guests. The hotel had excellent service, regardless of whether they were Turkish or foreign guests. The staff hovers around you. The hotel rooms were large and comfortable. Daily cleaning was done meticulously every day. When we lost small items like the slippers we left at the pool and the bottle of water we left at the restaurant, they immediately took care of us and brought them to our room. It is a family hotel and has a high level of entertainment concept. The food was excellent and the desserts were legendary. We had no shortage of sun loungers by the sea and the pool. I was struck by the presence of security personnel and lifeguards. The sea is a little wavy, the sandy beach suddenly becomes deeper. In the morning the sea is calm and clean. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to come. 28. Yorum: Average age between 60 and cemetery (maybe it sounds a bit bad but it was true), after the evening show at 10:00 pm, dead pants while the party continued in the neighboring hotels until 12:00 pm.... For 1500‚Ç¨ (9 days) the hotel was a fairly expensive retirement home. The workers were super friendly and the food was wonderful. What I found sad was that in other hotels you even had beach services for 1300‚Ç¨... Here you had to walk yourself and for that you paid an extra 200‚Ç¨ per nose... 90% German pensioners. You can count small children on one hand. It was great, especially for 1500‚Ç¨ to swim in rubbish (condoms, plastic bags for cups, etc.), because the jetty of the neighbouring hotel either fell into the sea or was washed away and dragged towards us by the current. 29. Yorum: I will be staying in room 1510 of the hotel where I will be checking out on September 1st. The variety of food is sufficient and there are drinks that will please your taste. New raki served Tekirdaƒü raki, Ballantines Red Jack whiskey. , Absolute is‚Ä¶ 30. Yorum: We had a very pleasant stay! The hotel is not far from the airport so you can get there very quickly. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Every wish will come true. The bartender Ali is particularly good and works very quickly and well. The pool area is really cool and kept very tidy so you feel very comfortable. The location near the beach is ideal! There is food everywhere‚Ä¶literally. It tastes fresh and delicious. Breakfast and dinner are very good. There's something for everyone. We can only recommend the hotel! 31. Yorum: We are staying at the hotel from September 1 to 10, 2024. It was first class. Really great food, great rooms, great atmosphere, always attentive to everything from service, from the kitchen to the cleaning and the gardeners. Everyone was very friendly and ‚ô°kind/warm‚ô° We booked the hotel directly for 2025. Fantastic. Kind regards Nina and Heiko Sieb 32. Yorum: The transfer from the airport took half an hour. The reception service was also very detailed. However, the room barely had a sea view as actually offered, as we had our room on the first floor, there was not much to see except the beautiful garden. From Invo, one side of the hotel looks directly at the neighboring hotel, which is quite densely built and slightly larger. Room service was great, room was cleaned very nicely for a small tip. The fridge is always full of drinks. The pool is very nice, there are also slides, but if you want to lie down after breakfast you have to hurry, because some guests probably come in the evening to reserve the "best" sunbeds and never lie on them - cheers to the Berlin towels. The beach is also clean and there are enough sun loungers, but small children find it a bit difficult to swim because the depth gets quite deep. The food was really great, very varied, with different nations as the theme each night. The animation was also varied. Location a little far from the center, of course you can get there by taxi. Prices this year have increased a lot compared to our last vacation. We still did a lot, I do not recommend booking excursions at the hotel. Just around the corner is Lila's travel agency, the woman speaks very good German and gave us very good advice. I was able to do that too. I saved a lot because I had already received several offers beforehand. There are many cats living on the premises and they are fed by numerous guests, which is of course very nice, but I really wish that the city and the numerous hotel owners who make a good profit from us would start neutering the cats, otherwise it will not be possible to avoid it. in animals that really don't have a good life. I can really recommend the hotel, of course there are small deductions, but it was a very pleasant and relaxing stay. I wish the area around the hotel would be kept clean, outside of the hotel complex. But the city is probably responsible for this. 33. Yorum: We spent our summer holidays at this hotel and were completely delighted. All facilities, as well as our room, were always clean and well maintained, which contributed to creating a pleasant atmosphere. The food was exceptionally delicious and exceeded our expectations. We would especially like to highlight the kindness and attention of the staff, who always tried to make our stay as pleasant as possible. The highlight was the daily game of darts with Tahsin, who made the game so entertaining that it was always a great pleasure to take part, even if you lost. Their commitment and good humor made the stay even better. Overall it was a fantastic holiday and I can only warmly recommend this hotel. 34. Yorum: Very clean hotel, spacious and well-equipped rooms. Free buffet, with a lot of variety and very good. The exterior is also very well maintained. In conclusion, very good value for money. I recommend... 35. Yorum: Great hotel that is not that big with excellent and dedicated staff. Unfortunately there are fewer sun loungers at the pool than necessary. In the morning it is stated that nothing can be booked, but nothing is done. Unfortunately, the‚Ä¶ 36. Yorum: In itself it is a nice hotel with a beautiful garden. The cleanliness of our room, especially in the bathroom, left a lot to be desired. Long photo. In nine days they didn't even clean the bathtub, where you also have to shower. We always enjoy the food. I found the quality to be absolutely fine. Unfortunately, the entertainment to the right and left of the neighbouring hotels is so loud that it is sometimes not possible to have a normal conversation during the day. This ruined our holiday relaxation. Now Melas can do nothing about it. But that's why the place has fewer stars. That's why I can only recommend the hotel to a limited extent. But the value for money was absolutely fine for us. We got a very good price for our stay. 37. Yorum: Unfortunately we were not satisfied with the Melas Lara hotel, which we chose based on a recommendation. We drove to the hotel and the security guard at the door couldn't find our name on the list and said, "Come in and check the‚Ä¶ 38. Yorum: The good: from the hotel to the sea, everything is great: 4+!!! Swimming pool with bar (any drinksüëå), beach bar, same, also a large selection of ice cream and fruits, you can also have lunch. The hotel restaurant is good, with a varied selection of dishes. The restaurant staff is great!!! , especially the waitress Ebru the waiter Zafar rating: 5+++. Now the disadvantages üòí: the hotel is old, the cleaning of the rooms is so-so (although everything shines in the lobby), the biggest disadvantage is the shore (the beach is sandy, but the entrance to the sea is pebble (piles of stones) and almost immediately deep, with children üò™, we walked along the coast (as much as we could) and everywhere there is such a coast üòí And the staff in the hotel lobby just killed me ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨. We will continue searching with mother-of-pearl buttons, but Lara is closed to me. 39. Yorum: The location of the hotel is close to the airport and is easily accessible. The hotel is really crowded. Despite this, there were no problems. All the staff are very attentive and hard-working. The cleanliness of the room is very good. The air conditioning cools very well. Complimentary minibar drinks are replenished daily. The breakfast is varied and delicious. The evening menu offers flavours from different cuisines. Both the pool bar and the snack bar are very good and varied. The sea was rough and unfortunately the coast was dirty. There are enough sun loungers for everyone. Evening activities are available every day. 40. Yorum: We stayed at the hotel with my daughter between August 24th and 31st. A true family hotel. We enjoyed it very much. Especially Mrs. Ali ≈ûahin and Elif, who worked at the pool bar, were very attentive. So is Mr. Selman in the restaurant section. In fact, the friendly and attentive attitude of the staff in general made us very happy. We will definitely choose again. 41. Yorum: It was a wonderful week of vacation. The hotel staff welcomed us warmly and we felt very comfortable. Our room was bright and modernly furnished, with partial sea views. And even further away you could see the mountains. The entire facility is very well maintained. The staff is friendly and very careful. The entertainment was very good and low key, which we found very enjoyable. The fish restaurant on the 12th floor is highly recommended, it has a fantastic view. To get to the sea you walk a little through the beautiful garden with many flowers. 42. Yorum: The cleaning and room service were very good. We liked having a different food concept every night. We were very happy. Only some waiters were very grumpy. By the way, everything was perfect. It is very high, so it is quieter than other hotels. 43. Yorum: The hotel is great. We were here 5 years ago. The hotel is right on the beach. It can be reached on foot through the beautiful complex. In the complex you can lie on the grass or by the pool. The pool area is very nice with 3 slides. All facilities are very clean and well maintained. The food is delicious. Every evening a new theme evening is organized in the restaurant. The staff is very attentive, friendly and pleasant... 44. Yorum: Luxurious all-inclusive hotel, which is one of the smallest hotels in the area with more than 300 rooms on 10 floors. The hotel has many German-speaking regular guests. All rooms with side balcony facing the sea. The east wing (left) has a slightly better view; to the right, the pompous Royal Holiday Palace is partially illuminated by the sun. Special mention should be made of + Cleanliness, the beach bathrooms are also cleaned periodically. + Rich buffet in the main restaurant, friendly service. + Extensive all-inclusive offer with many drinks, cocktails and popsicles, also at the beach bar + Large and very pleasant lobby lounge with terrace + Snack bar on the beach and pool, where you can also have lunch in a swimsuit - Negative: at night it is noisy everywhere, but it belongs to the Turkish Riviera - One star deduction for rooms with a bathtub instead of a shower, not without risk for older semesters 45. Yorum: We went on a recommendation. We enjoyed it as a family and we were satisfied. It is a hotel. The food is good, the rooms are clean, of course, you need a team for this and that team is in this hotel, thank you. Thanks to all the staff, they do their job correctly. I would like to thank Mr. Ali and the animation team. 46. Yorum: The hotel is really run down. Unfortunately, the food is the same every other day and there was generally little choice. The rooms are getting old and should be renovated. The service is also bad. But the doctor is greatüëçüèª 47. Yorum: From arrival to departure everything was great. We felt very comfortable and will definitely return. The food was excellent, my special praise and thanks to the restaurant staff, what they do is mega. I can only praise the reception, always with a smile on their face, always friendly, good knowledge of several languages, helpful and accommodating. The animation team is great, but the music still needs work - sometimes too loud so you can barely hear your own conversation, sometimes too low so you can hear the neighbouring hotels better than ours. The type of music is not entirely possible, you would like more atmospheric music, something modern, that reminds you of the Christmas holidays and not just something that is on, the main thing is that there is something playing in the background. A huge thank you to the staff who keep the whole area clean and pretty, to the photographers, to the sauna staff, in particular the Hamam staff, to the beach security, to all the bar staff. We felt very comfortable everywhere, thank you for that. 48. Yorum: A very nice hotel. The staff is very friendly and always helpful. There is really nothing to wish for, the food is excellent every day. It doesn't matter if it's a varied breakfast, lunch or dinner. There are theme parties every night üëçüèª We will definitely come back to enjoy our holidays here. Thanks to the whole team! You are awesome!!!! 49. Yorum: The hotel staff was very attentive, friendly and solution-oriented. Even for my personal problem, the lady serving drinks in the dining room was very helpful. The food was excellent, there was a lot of variety and it was delicious, there were examples of. World cuisine and desserts were also very popular. The beach was sandy, we never had any problems with sun loungers, it was just a bit of sea. It can be a problem for those who cannot swim deep. The cleaning was also good, the only thing that caught my attention was the lack of slippers in the room. It was a fairly quiet hotel, those who like a lot of entertainment may feel the deficiency, perhaps the entertainment part was enough for me. Overall, it was a hotel that I was very pleased with. 50. Yorum: Everything is beautiful. The waiters are friendly and the food is excellent. The location of the hotel is very good. I'm thinking of coming once again. The downside is that the elevator is not sufficient and the evening shows could have been better. Apart from that, I came with my wife and my 8-month-old son. Everything was beautiful. 51. Yorum: The hotel is highly recommended, all the staff are very nice and friendly, always helpful. Everything was explained in detail at the reception. We booked a room with a sea view, you saw it all. The food is very tasty and always varied. Definitely recommended. 52. Yorum: The food in general is good. Few vegetarian options (about 10% of the buffet). Salads give you more options. I found the service impressive. The king size bed was fitted with a queen size duvet. After repeated calls this has still not been rectified. The excuse was that there was no one in the room to open the door when they came to change the duvet and they left. No reason was given for the lack of response to subsequent requests when we WERE in the room. In the end he physically went down to reception. The staff was not helpful, I just left it. The service in general is not at 5 star level. 53. Yorum: A truly fantastic hotel! The rooms are very small but completely sufficient. It was super clean and the food tasted great. The beach is super nice and the pools were heated at the beginning of May which we thought was great so the mini could splash around nicely :) 54. Yorum: From here I would like to ask the hotel management, how do they get their employees to be so kind and hospitable in a business? sincere, from the welcome to the farewell, Mrs. Ebru from the beach bar, Mr. Victory, our room. I would like to sincerely thank our sister Leyla, who took care of the cleaning, and all the employees whose other names I do not remember. as if they were in your home, not in a hotel. The staff looked after me like a mother, father, sister, brother, rather than an employee. See you again, Melas family. 55. Yorum: Very happy with this place. I came here for my holidays just to relax and unwind and I can't remember when I felt so relaxed. The hotel is incredibly clean and constantly attended to by friendly staff. The variety of different foods is outstanding. You no longer need to get up at 8 a.m. m., as the restaurant serves a late breakfast for those who like to sleep in a little longer ü•±. Very impressed and definitely highly recommended for anyone looking to disconnect from the outside world. ‚ù§Ô∏è 56. Yorum: The hotel is right on the Turkish Riviera and is only 15 minutes from the airport. The rooms are clean, spacious and modern with sea views. The pool area and private beach area are excellently maintained. The hotel service is first class, with friendly and helpful staff. The food at the buffet restaurant is varied and tastes very good. Overall, the Melas Lara Hotel is an excellent choice for a relaxing and luxurious holiday. Highly recommended! 57. Yorum: We spent a holiday with 2 children. We stayed in the family room. The spaciousness and view of the room were beautiful. It took some effort to set up the television channels. The rooms were‚Ä¶ 58. Yorum: We spent a wonderful week at the Melas Lara Hotel in July 2022. A beautiful view from the seventh floor of a beautifully maintained garden, the sea and the beach, which is about 300 m away. The path to the beach is a pleasure among the well-kept vegetation, benches along the path and two bars where you can enjoy a cold drink or a delicious coffee and snacks. Of course, there are umbrellas next to the sun loungers, which we paid for. Special attention when choosing a hotel. The distances between the sun loungers are comfortable. Slightly inclined descent to the sea, the bottom covered with pleasant gravel. About 5 m from the shore, the depth of the sea is 120 cm to 150 cm. Holel has a wonderful location and is about 20 minutes from the airport. Antalya. As for food, it is a balm for the palate, a very wide and varied selection. Nice room with a comfortable bed, impeccable cleanliness in the room and in all facilities. Thank you very much for the friendly service from all the staff. and for a great vacation. We recommend it 100% and we will definitely be back. 59. Yorum: Today is the last day. Conclusion: Excellent location, you can reach the beach in a few minutes on foot. The activities are great too. A1 food without complaints. The staff was always friendly and helpful. The volume on the left and right systems is a bit loud, but you get used to it. I can only recommend this hotel and everything that goes with it. 60. Yorum: I was there with my daughter in July 2024 and I was very impressed. We visited this hotel for the first time and it definitely won't be the last. The cleanliness, food and friendliness of the staff were really great. Of course, a great animation team also helps. Thank you very much MELAS LARA‚ù§Ô∏è an extra thank you also to all the waiters who always had a smile on their face despite the extreme heat. But our top 2 were ERKAN UNDELIF, great kit, great price/performance ratioü•∞ 61. Yorum: I was in this hotel for the third time a week ago. I didn't know you could always overcome. When I arrived, an employee immediately collected my suitcase. I was allowed to sit down and immediately offered something to drink. The holidays are just around the corner. I had 12 days of pure luxury and attention from the hotel staff. My dear G√ºlten played an important role in my wonderful holiday. (The heart and soul of this hotel) Ozan from the lobby bar. My dear Burcu from guest relations, who also provided me with so many comforts. Besides Suna. Of course, there are many more notable employees. However, that would go beyond the scope here. This hotel goes out of its way to make you feel very special as a guest. I'll be right back. I hope soon. Next year at the latest. I miss my friends a lot. This hotel is a pearl. Please, dear guests, the staff always treats you with kindness. everyone deserves it 62. Yorum: During our stay at your hotel we had the pleasure of enjoying an all-inclusive reservation and our expectations were exceeded in every way. Your team was always punctual, polite and helpful. The 24-hour availability of food and drink was excellent and made our stay especially comfortable. Our room was clean, comfortable and tastefully decorated with great attention to detail. The hotel grounds were always well kept and the pool area had plenty of sun loungers and towels. What impressed us most was the proximity to the beach and the numerous shopping possibilities in the area, which made our stay even more enjoyable. I definitely recommend your hotel and am already looking forward to our next holiday with you. LG poor 63. Yorum: A shallow shower should be installed in the bathroom. The neighboring hotels are annoying because they have extremely loud entertainment in the mornings and evenings. The garden is very pretty with many trees for shade. 64. Comment: 1. Arrival: Your vacation begins in the lobby. Small refreshments are available for guests at the entrance. We immediately felt at home, the staff is very helpful and friendly. We arrived early in the morning and the room was not ready yet. After checking in we were able to go straight to breakfast and then to our room. 2. Buffet/All-in: the dishes and meals leave nothing to be desired! There is something for everyone, with salads, starters, main dishes, soups and desserts that change daily. Minibar/coffee/tea replenished daily. Numerous national and international cocktails in the bars (3 pieces) included. Beer, wine and soft drinks available throughout. The snacks at the pool and beach bars are different and cater to all tastes. 3. Offers: on the ground floor there are shops, a hairdresser and a doctor. Evening programme changes daily and during the day the entertainment team is present at the pool. There is an employee in the lobby every day to handle additional guest requests such as: B. Get a bouquet of flowers for your birthday. You can come to her with anything, she will help you and organize. 4. Wellness: We had booked a package at the hammam and were pampered for 1.5 hours and were able to completely relax. Special thanks to Ece. The spa area is very nice and quiet. We are happy to have booked this locally. 5th room: very nice, quite large, balcony equipped with adjustable sun loungers and table. The side sea view here really means that I have a beautiful sea view. Very clean rooms, special thanks to Nevin, our cleaning angel. 6. WiFi: Available throughout the hotel, whether in the room, pool or beach. ¬°Mega! 7. Staff: Even though the season was coming to an end and we knew that, whether in service, at the reception, in garden maintenance, in cleaning or in other areas, the employees have to work a lot, we always had the feeling that we were really welcome. Thank you all, because this warmth can no longer be taken for granted. I could write much more, but our conclusion is: Melas Lara was and is the right choice for us. We will definitely be booking again and look forward to seeing you again. Highly recommended! 65. Yorum: The hotel was located close to the airport, right next to the sea, with a large and clean pool. The disadvantages were that foreigners were given more importance in the games during the day and were not informed about the games. There was no water. or coffee in the rooms, there were no slippers in the rooms, they were not provided at all. The staff in general. We would also like to thank Ms. Elif, who was at the pool bar, was attentive and friendly. The face and solution-oriented nature were great. 66. Comment: 1-The beds are very old 2-They couldn't get rid of the smell in the room we stayed in 3-The management is very rude 4-There are curses in the air because there are few Turkish people 5-Take your hair conditioner and go 6-Contact Burcu from Customer Relations because she is the best at lying as if you said things you didn't say. You may also get bored of his self-praise, you may not be as patient as my wife and I. 6- The cat house is under the sun, the water bowls are empty and dirty, according to Ms. Burcu, the tips collected for the cats are insufficient and the cats are not asked for a fee, big cat cat. 7- Your bed is not tied, even if they say they are sorry, there is no difference between being tied or not. From 06:00 onwards, the hotel starts a competition to grab a poolside sunbed, so you can even see people sleeping. 9- The beach towels have turned into dust rags from being washed. 10- The staff of this hotel are very nice and the waiters are very likeable. Nuran at the lobby, all the gentlemen at the restaurant, we thank them all very much. 11- When we entered the hotel, a gentleman was working at the reception, he had been working for 15 years. He handles everything including greeting customers and finding reservations because the young man with glasses can't do con and can't get ahead of the other ambos arca. 12-Actually, I wasn't going to go into detail, but the ugly and aggressive response that was obviously given by Ms. Burcu to my first comment made it necessary. Due to Mrs. Burcu, I don't know who approved it, so I'll delete my comment and rewrite it as quickly as possible. Every part of the room we stayed in, except the kids' room, smelled musty and there was a stench coming from the air conditioning. Their technical team came, but the smell could not be eliminated. Their beds are very old and we didn't realize we needed to ask for a double bed as our reservation made it clear we were husband and wife. Asking for hair conditioner in a 5-star hotel seemed absurd to me. You said you didn't agree at all with the CEO's instructions, how quickly you forgot about it. They serve the margarita in a plastic cup and write as if they were asked for it outside the bar, answers like that do not cover the facts. I don't know what the cat tip box at the entrance to the lobby bar, your supposed cat house in the sun, is for. I was told that we are not a cat rehabilitation center, we are not a cat collection center. You are incompetent enough to have 5 cats in the big hotel and not get any treatment, but you complain about the cats in the hotels next door. While Mrs. Burcu lived happily as a tenant in her house in Muratpa≈üa for 11,000 TL, you, as a teacher's daughter, did not learn not to lie to customers. You don't like anything at the hotel, it's not hard to understand why. Since I didn't ask you to be honest about the years you spent as a hostess and Deplhin and Barut Hotels asked you to satisfy your ego with us, we had a good time. It's just that my wife told you a lie to your face and then you accepted it anyway. I never told them that I made money, I mentioned the names of the hotels I stayed in, some of which you can see in my videos on the Instagram page. I've always been a popular guest, but you couldn't love me or a liar like you. I would like to remind you of your incredibly offensive comments about expatriate clients. I just had one conversation with Mrs. Emma on the premises and she expressed her complaint about the furnishings in her room and about you. In fact, yesterday she told me on Instagram that you charged 384 TL for an eye cream that costs 84 TL. If you continue with your rude comments, please be advised that I will officially contact the hotel with the screenshot.

Yorum: Great hotel, amazing buffet, great German speaking staff, great pool, beach right next to the hotel, only negative thing was that the shower was in the bathtub. But that's complaining at a high level. 68. Yorum: I just returned from spending 10 nights at Melas Lara and I loved it! ||We arrived to a great reception and the kids were enthralled! Greeted by the staff very politely and warmly, check in was quick and painless and then we were helped‚Ä¶ 69. Yorum: The Melas Hotel positively surprised me! This is my first time here but it definitely won't be my last :) The hotel is very clean and the food is of great quality and there is no lack of variety. The service is excellent! I would like to give special praise to the animators Raman and Tahsin. The boys lead the activities, are full of energy and transmit good humor. They are extremely committed and give the hotel an extra touch of freshness! The little guests are also well looked after. Mrs. Selin is super reliable and a person with a big heart! Overall, I recommend the hotel without any qualms of conscience. Always happy to come here. Many thanks to the entire Melas team for this great experience ‚ù§Ô∏è PS: a little tip visit the professional hotel photographer Mr. Emirhan ‚ú® 70. Yorum: We spent 3 nights with my children. We left the hotel quite satisfied. The rooms are spacious and clean. The cleaning is fine, the room next door is cleaned a little earlier, but the noise doesn't bother me. Maybe it shouldn't be done between 8 and 9. An animal-friendly hotel. There is a cat house and they are fed regularly. The names of the trees and flowers were written on it, we really liked it, although we noticed some mistakes. The waiters are polite and attentive. Whatever you want, they order it immediately and bring it to your table without you having to ask where the waiter is. The food is very varied and delicious. The main restaurant and pool/sea sections are also quite satisfactory. There is always ice cream available. The sea was beautiful but we couldn't enjoy it. Since it was April, it wasn't hot, so I went in and out once. There were jellyfish when we went. The staff also cleaned it. The pool is not very big but it works well. The animation team was generally friendly and polite. A hotel we would choose again. 71. Yorum: In this hotel they stole headphones worth ‚Ç¨200 from me. It's not a lot of money to me, but apparently it's too much for others to be worth stealing. The security man is one of the most incompetent people there is. After 5 days I still have not received a response to my request to review the cameras. For those of you who have to pay for your vacation in installments, please stay home or go to cheaper hotels. 72. Yorum: For me this hotel is the best in Lara! Not too big but nice and guest are welcome‚Ä¶ Guest relations manager Mrs. Nazan Cankir is very helpful and friendly and will give you a warm welcome... Another big compliment for the LobbyBar, last year I was only in the lobby 1 or 2 times, and this year I don't want to leave the lobby at all... They do a great job for the well-being of the guests, many thanks to G√ºlten, Zeynep, Serkan, Can, Ozan... I felt good last year, I feel better this year and I will definitely be back next year! The food tastes good‚Ä¶ The rooms are clean‚Ä¶ Pool bar, beach bar, lobby, everyone goes out of their way and does a great job! I also think it's great that those in charge get involved and greet the guests, serve them, etc. Thank you Melas Lara team! 73. Yorum: One of the smallest hotels on the Strip. The hotel is a little dated. But don't let that stop you. The staff is very friendly. When we were there, there were few Russians. On the other hand, many Germans. The staff will often assist you in German. But they also speak excellent English. For the a la carte restaurant we opted for the fish restaurant on the 12th floor. What a great view. The food is nothing special. The buffet food, on the other hand, is great. Lots of variety and more than enough options. All in all, a nice, slightly dated hotel with excellent service, friendly staff and good food at the buffet. 74. Yorum: We were there for 5 days, but every day was an experience. We had a good rest here at the beginning of May. The room was clean, good mattresses and well furnished. The service is excellent, every guest is really looked after and helped. The food was very well presented. The taste was also good, otherwise the food could be refined with a large selection of spices and sauces. The choice of employment opportunities was abundant. There are some small shops in the hotel so you should make sure the price is not double, otherwise you will have to report it to the reception. The area is really worth seeing and is accessible by bus or car, so don't just consider the hotel as a holiday, but explore the area. 75. Yorum: We were warmly welcomed upon arrival and immediately given something to drink. All the staff were very friendly and always very helpful. Our room was very nice with a partial sea view and was always cleaned and serviced. Also, the minibar was replenished immediately when it was empty. All facilities were clean as were the bathrooms/showers on the beach etc. We will also have fond memories of the animation team, they were all always very friendly and in a good mood. Our son really enjoyed going to the kids club. The food was plentiful and tasty and there was something for everyone's taste. As mentioned in other reviews, the only drawback is that the two neighboring hotels are very noisy. Although after a few days you don't notice it anymore. And Melas can't do anything about it. The Melas Hotel makes every effort to ensure that its guests always find peace and quiet and can relax properly. Thus, the evening programme and the ‚Äúloudest‚Äù music end at 11:00 p.m. It was a really nice holiday and I can definitely recommend the hotel. 76. Yorum: We are very satisfied with the hotel service. All the staff are friendly and the food is excellent. Unfortunately, the neighboring hotels to the right and left are very noisy with their entertainment. The price-performance ratio was absolutely fine for us, so we will definitely be back soon! 77. Yorum: Great hotel, exceptionally good food, super friendly and courteous staff, plus a very nice beach with outdoor facilities. Conclusion: Highly recommended! 78. Comment: Wow, wow. There is no other way to describe this hotel. When we arrived we were greeted very warmly. This hotel, which appears discreet from the outside, hides behind its fa√ßade a truly wonderful stay. Starting with the friendly staff, excellent service and great cuisine with its varied food. The cleanliness of the rooms also left nothing to be desired. 79. Yorum: We went as a couple a week ago. We were at Melas for the first time and we really liked it, especially the dining room. Mrs. EBRU and Mr. Jusuf were always attentive, kind and respectful. The praise went to our cleaning lady (unfortunately I don't know her name). ) in room 1433. Thank you all very much, we had a good rest, we will be back. I would definitely recommend Hotel Melas. You are doing a good job, keep it up!!! 80. Yorum: We stayed at the Melas Hotel for a week and we are very satisfied. Whether it was the positive atmosphere that all employees tried to maintain or the food in the restaurants. In particular, Ms. Ebru made us feel very comfortable. She always had a smile on her face and her good humor passed it on to us. Thanks for a great Christmas week! 81. Yorum: An excellent hotel Whether it is the service, the food, the people who work. One more than the other, they are equally magnificent and amazingly beautiful. Thank you very much Enese for the reception. How much did he care about us? I have never seen a person as humble as Yakub Kaptan in my life. Erka's service was so perfect that our table was never left empty. Emine Hanim's words surprised us. We were pleased with Mrs. Gamze's cheerful demeanor. I don't understand why some people give low stars here. First of all, I recommend that you learn how to be a guest. If you look for faults you will find them, but this hotel and the people who work there are really great. Thank you for everything we will be back again 82. Yorum: We stayed at Melas Lara for 7 nights. First of all, we were satisfied overall. Two out of three people are celiac and depend on gluten-free foods. We had already discussed this with the hotel in advance, it would not be a problem. Unfortunately, this caused problems. There were great risks of contamination. Gluten-free foods were wrapped in wrappers, making them no longer edible for us. There were also some weaknesses among the staff, sometimes they told us that the rice contained gluten, sometimes it was gluten-free. We also had to find someone to ask us what was gluten-free for us at every meal. We know it differently than other hotels. The staff knew this and always gave us a responsible person who took 5 minutes to explain everything to us and not just half the buffet. Therefore, it is generally not suitable for people with celiac disease. (Luckily we had half a suitcase full of food, from experience üòÇ) BUT as I said, overall the hotel was very nice. A nice facility with a large lawn, if it is not too hot you can also play there. The hotel seems to take good care of the cats there. The beach was a bit boring as it was pebble, but with bathing shoes that was not a problem. The eternal German theme with sun lounger reservations... in the pool and on the beach. It's best to rush out at 6 a.m. m.üôÑ, but the hotel can't do anything about it. The service was also good, the waitresses were stressed, you could tell. In the evening, in the lobby bar, it took quite a while before you were served again. Then sometimes we go to the bar ourselves, you still have two healthy legs üòâ We were often asked if we could change the change. Overall we had a wonderful 7 days. 83. Yorum: Yes, very good hotel. Very minor inconvenience due to the long walk to the beach. Very dedicated staff! Very comfortable rooms! Our recommendationüëç 84. Yorum: We, 2 adults and a 3 year old child, stayed at Melas Lara for 10 days. The hotel is getting a bit old. We had a family room on the ninth floor, with two separate bedrooms. Excellent view, balcony directly to the pool area and partial sea view and panoramic views of the beach and sea from the window. The cleanliness of the rooms was good. The hotel staff was always friendly. The waiters were, for the most part, attentive. The animation team were entertaining, the kids club was also great and varied. The evening events were mega, samba show, Mongolian circus and a magician to name a few. The food, especially the dinner buffet, was excellent, every day a different theme (Italian, Asian, International cuisine and Turkish night on Friday). Many options, arranged with love and imagination. You can also have lunch at the beach bar or the pool bar. Drinks, cocktails and ice cream as much as you wanted, and in the afternoon there were waffles or churros. You can always eat and drink. We were a little annoyed that there were occasional power cuts, both day and night, so the air conditioning stopped immediately. The area is very rich in flowers, it is well maintained and each tree has a plaque with its name. The walk to the beach is about 500m, but if you walk through the garden it won't be a pain. There are also cats, but they have their own cat house on the property and they are fed there as well. We really enjoyed our holiday and would definitely return. Maybe we can still renew something in the next few years. 85. Yorum: The holidays were really great. Many thanks to everyone who works there. And a very special thanks to Erkan (waiter), I hope his efforts are also rewarded :) 86. Yorum: The review refers to my parents' vacation: We spent a very pleasant vacation at the Melas Lara Hotel. The hotel and grounds leading to the beach were beautiful and well maintained. The food was very tasty every day and there was a great selection of different dishes, including dessert. The service, especially Emine, Ozlem and Ebru, were always friendly, good-humoured and very helpful. Mesude always made sure we had a clean room. Best wishes to everyone :) The only thing we didn't like was that our room had a bathtub, which we didn't like very much; However, you can get a room with a shower upon request. We will probably be back! 87. Yorum: It was a wonderful 7 days at the hotel. It is super clean, everything smells great and the staff is very friendly and attentive. The room was also very clean and the minibar was refilled immediately. The long meal times are great and there was always more than enough food, the Turkish evening is particularly good in terms of what it offers. Both the beach and the pool are very clean. The entertainers are not aggressive and are very friendly. We will definitely be back! 88. Yorum: This hotel is as far from a 5 star facility as the moon üåõ is from the earth üåé the rooms and the condition of the hotel is poor - the only money üí∞ to be made from this old facility are the defective spots everywhere. The rooms no longer meet current standards. It is not possible to get a sun lounger by the pool if you do not get up at 6:30 am. m. and you make a reservation. The food was okay, but nothing more than that. The beach is fine, but there is no pier or service. Very friendly and helpful staff. The animation is good but always the same. I would not book it again. Kind regards, Franco. 89. Yorum: Second time here, and again everything was great üëç excellent food, super nice üëç Excellent guest service üëå can definitely be recommended. Thank you very much ‚ò∫Ô∏è 90. Yorum: Okay!! The employees speak very good German and you can communicate 100%. The evening activities are great and the staff is VERY friendly. Nothing bad to say about the hotel, highly recommended!! 91. Yorum: I have expat holidays every year in summer. I have been to many hotels, but in a word, I came across Melas hotel, which is a wonderful hotel. I was especially surprised by the staff. Victory Bey for his sincere services. I hope to see you as soon as possible. 92. Yorum: Hotel with very good food (morning, lunch, afternoon and snacks). Great service and very friendly. Everything was very clean and well maintained (rooms, pool, garden). Shopping opportunities nearby, such as shops, pharmacies, ... Good evening programme with shows. Highly recommended hotel. The location is also very good. Not far from the center and very close to the airport. 93. Yorum: Nice and well maintained complex/hotel/pool. Best service ever, if you like it you get enough entertainment, the animators work hard. I was very pleasantly surprised by the catering, from food to drinks: everything was excellent and there was something available at any time. Oasis of calm: a garden between the beach and the pool. Sandy beach until just before the shore. Good location, not far from the airport and 2 minutes from the hotel to the shops. 94. Yorum: The hotel looks great on the booking pages, but it is actually misleading. The service is quite good, except for room service in the dining room. Sometimes we had to wait 15 minutes for a drink. There is a beach club next door, but the pool area is not very enclosed. There is not much rest during the season because every pensioner puts on his towel at 8 a.m. m. after the show at 9 p.m. m. the hotel is dead and everyone goes to sleep. It's too expensive for what little you get. I would recommend that you do not spend a few hundred euros more to go to the other hotels nearby. The worst "5 star hotel" in Antalya Lara is always the same. has nothing to do with Mexican cuisine, see 95. Yorum: The rooms are fine, unfortunately our room always smelled a bit (drainage issues?). Great food and service. And many congratulations to the Mini Club. Such a fantastic and dedicated staff... especially Nastia, who always encouraged my children to do activities. Selina is also A1! Happy to be back! 96. Yorum: It is a select, classic and beautiful hotel. Very attentive and friendly staff. Excellent food. Cleanliness everywhere. I had a dream vacation without shortage in Melas Lara. 97. Yorum: The hotel is great. It is clean, well maintained and the service is commendable. Thank you so much for the wonderful time with our family. 98. Yorum: Wonderful hotel! Excellent food, drinks, cleanliness and beauty! Special thanks to the staff, they are very responsive, the reception is the best! 99. Yorum: Umbrellas on the beach are a bad idea. For this reason we will definitely not book the hotel again. The sun is very pleasant here. 100. Yorum: We know Lara's hotels well, having stayed in 5 different ones. In terms of quality/price ratio, Melas is at the top.||Very pleasant stay, the positive points:||- Green, pleasant and well-kept territory.|- Staff‚Ä¶ 101. Yorum: We were very satisfied with the hotel and the staff and service. The employees are very friendly and nice. Erkan in particular at the restaurant was very friendly and attentive.

The highest praise and respect to the team that provides the all-inclusive service with attention to every detail. And to those who are always unhappy with the negativity about the sea water temperature and‚Ä¶ 105. Yorum: A very nice holiday, great! The food was varied and very, very tasty. The staff was very friendly and attentive, the whole area was very nice to look at and clean. The animators encourage guests to play sports. Great fun on the beach (petanque, volleyball games). Great nightclub at night. Everything is clean (thanks to the lady who serviced room 1501). Many thanks to the chefs! Many thanks to the waitress. MEMIK, IBRAHIM and EBRU The best!!! Always smiling, very friendly, very hard-working. Your service is at the highest level! I really enjoyed my stay (19.05-29.05 2024) at Hotel Melas Lara and I recommend it 100%. Sincerely Ivana and Yaroslav 106. Yorum: Beautiful hotel, this is probably our eighth time here, we are very satisfied, I am also glad that the internet reception has improved significantly, right on the sea, that's why we give top marks, of course we will come here again. Once again, greetings to the entire management of Melas Lara, we give 5 points to Andrzej and Matylda MIELNO Poland 107. Yorum: We stayed at the Melas Lara Hotel in May 2024 and had to leave early for personal reasons. We have been trying to get confirmation of our early departure for 3 weeks as our insurance requires it. After numerous calls and emails, the Melas Lara Hotel refuses to issue this confirmation for reasons that are inexplicable to me. Service, customer friendliness and overall communication are extremely poor. 108. Yorum: The staff is friendly and helpful, the food is delicious, the comfort is of the highest standard, it was a very enjoyable holiday, I hope to come back again (my note to the authoritative friend who organised the evening entertainment, please do better, the hotel wants this).
