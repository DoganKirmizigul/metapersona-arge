1. Comment: The location, comfort and cleanliness are very good. 400 meters below the Hagia Sophia mosque. The Golden Horn is 600 meters away. There is a parking lot. The buffet breakfast was very tasty and sufficient. 2. Comment: We were very pleased. The employees are very attentive and friendly. We stayed for about 4 days as a family and we felt very comfortable. Many of the attractions in Sirkeci are close by. It is located right next to G√ºlhane station. And the price is definitely more affordable compared to other hotels. Definitely recommended! 3. Comment: The hotel is very good in terms of location, security and staff. The rooms are cleaned every day, the breakfast is good and all the staff are really helpful. A safe hotel to stay with family, friends or even alone as a woman. They help you immediately when you have a question or problem. We were very pleased againüëçüèºI couldn't make a reservation online because the hotel seemed full, so I tried my luck by phone. Comment: The hotel is really clean. We always prefer to stay here when we come to Istanbul. A hotel where I feel comfortable with my family. Because here we feel the same comfort as we feel at home. The staff is friendly and attentive. The rooms are extremely clean. ‚Ä¶ 5. Comment: I do not recommend this hotel. The bathrooms are very old and there is a constant smell. The rug on the floor was not clean, there were black stains 6. Comment: We came here on holiday with my family. The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly and hardworking. The location of the hotel is close to everywhere and is full of attractions and nice restaurants. I recommend this hotel to everyone and I will come again myself. üëçüèº ‚Ä¶ 7. Comment: The hotel was really great in terms of both cleanliness and staff. The rooms were very comfortable. If we come to Istanbul again, I will choose this hotel again. I would recommend this hotel to everyone with peace of mind. 8. Comment: The hotel is close to everywhere, in the middle of all places worth seeing in terms of history and religion... What a beautiful part of the city.||Tram, Metro etc. are within walking distance.||||Hygiene rules and cleanliness are at the highest level.||The hotel staff are all respectful and helpful‚Ä¶ 9. Comment: It was an absolutely awful experience. The only person left that wasn't beaten was the reception. I had booked a double room. My friend had logged in before me in the evening. Although he wanted to pay when he checked in, the reception stated that he could collect the fee when he checked out due to the busy schedule. I also wanted to enter around 6 in the morning of that day. However, the receptionist wanted to receive the payment immediately. When I told him that I had no money on me and that my friend would pay, he did not accept it. He said, "Tell your friend to bring the money." Oh, you are innocent... Why would I wake up at 6 in the morning? Isn't it a shame? We are not running away, after all we will pay the money. Moreover, they stated that they wanted to buy it at the exit. I insisted too. I told you what we will pay in cash. Then he said, "I'm not taking you." He said, "Go outside." HE OFFICIALLY FIRED ME!!! But since it was a time when I couldn't leave my friend alone, I had to go upstairs, get the money, and pay. Moreover, he wanted more than the price we had previously agreed on the phone. My hands and feet are already shaking with anger. My advice to you is do not stay at this hotel, which does not value its customers at all and employs staff who are beating the heck out of you in the early hours of the morning. If you noticed, I didn't say a word about the room. Because customer satisfaction is like the unofficial law of hotels. What should I do with the room when that's not there? We already checked out at 12 noon. So we were going to stay for at least 6 hours. That man poisoned us. I am calling out to you, the sensitive employees of Olympic Hotel... The receptionist was a white-haired man who wore glasses. I think his name was Hasan. If you accept these events as normal, then you are no different from him. Otherwise, please do what is necessary... 10. Comment: The location is very good, but the single room I stayed in was like a closed 15m2 grave. The room window faces the wall. Breakfast is okay at 11. Comment: I would like to thank Mr. Sati and the Olympic team. The hotel is clean and affordable. Family hotel.

Comment: The reception staff is very friendly, the rooms are cleaned every day and it is a very safe hotel. This is my 11th visit here on the 13th. Yorum: 5 stars are not enough. A hotel in a top location. Very friendly staff, was there exactly 4 times. Even 5 stars is too little. I was very pleased. I stay at this hotel every time I go to Istanbul. The employees, cleaning staff etc. are very clean and meticulous. Best regards, Sivaslƒ±_Serdar 14. Comment: First of all, the staff, tobacco, all the employees are very attentive, the hotel is the most beautiful hotel you can stay in, the rooms are clean and comfortable, the breakfast is good, thank you for everything, my respects and greetings from Konya to the Olympic family 15. Comment: I spent my holiday as a traveler this year and stayed in 5 star hotels in all the cities I visited, but the cleanliness, friendliness of the staff and the cleanliness of the rooms in this beautiful hotel belonging to the Ya≈ümak group deserves not five stars but all stars. Ya≈ümak group, thank goodness you exist 16. Comment: The only hotel I stayed at in Istanbul and I wish I hadn't. FYI, the room is as big as your pantry at home and I got really cranky while taking a dirty shower. 17. Comment: We were very pleased with the Olympic Hotel, which we visited with our family. We were given a warm welcome. Its location is central, transportation is close to everywhere. The staff is very polite, especially Hasan and Sati, who work at the reception, were very helpful. I recommend it to everyone.

If I come again, I would say Olympics again..||Love and greetings from Germany.. 23. Comment: Yasmak is the hotel that is directed to when there is no space in the luxury sections of the hotels, but it has lost prestige. He should also take care of this hotel or remove the name Ya≈ümak. 24. Comment: In terms of location, it is a hotel with parking problems for private vehicles, but in terms of tourism and culture, it is a mid-range hotel in a first-class location. 25. Comment: A place that can be trusted both in terms of transportation and location. I met the 3 people working in the lobby and they are really great people. The room I stayed in was a bit small (103) but I can't say it was bad as it didn't matter to me. 26. Comment: A hotel within the Ya≈ümak Hotels chain, the service quality is very good, the staff is friendly and conscious. 27. Comment: A few days' stay in Istanbul can be made much more enjoyable with this solution-oriented team that constantly tries to help its customers. 28.

The breakfast buffet is adequate but the variety could be increased. The location is perfect. Great value for money. 66. Comment: Overall I had a great stay at the hotel. This is a family-friendly environment with a relaxed atmosphere. The staff was warm and welcoming. Although the rooms seem small, they are well equipped and comfortable. It is also cleaned every morning and well‚Ä¶ 67. Comment: The hotel is very nice with a perfect location, the atmosphere is great. The breakfast is delicious and the rooms are always clean. The staff were wonderful, especially the receptionist Hasan, who was extremely warm and funny. In any case, I can recommend this hotel with all my heart and you should definitely meet this guy Hasan. 68. Comment: The hotel is located in the very centre of the Old Town, surrounded by many tourist attractions. But this also has its drawbacks - prices in cafes and restaurants, in shops are exorbitant. ‚Ä¶ 69. Comment: The location of the hotel is excellent, all tourist attractions are within walking distance. It's generally clean, but that's hard to tell in a 3x3 room where most of the space is taken up by the bed. ‚Ä¶ 70. Comment: The hotel has a great location, super central and within walking distance to the river you can reach everything. The employees are very nice and welcoming. We were there at 9am and check in isn't until 2pm and 15 minutes later we still didn't have a room... 71. Comment: The rooms are dirty. I had to switch rooms because the voicemail was on 24 hours a day which made it impossible to sleep. The new room was quiet but the toilet smelled like sewage/drainage. I strongly advise against this hotel, so pay a few more euros and book nearby hotels. But the location is perfect, only the hotel is bad. 72. Comment: Do not trust the rating given by a first-time contributor.||This is our second visit to Istanbul. It was not easy to reach this hotel. The small road in front of the hotel was closed to traffic so our driver found the perfect spot to stop‚Ä¶ 73. Comment: Great location... The best views are literally right on your doorstep. |A clean, well-maintained atmosphere. The staff is very friendly and helpful. We can only recommend the hotel and would be happy to return ourselves. The shopping opportunities are also excellent. 74. Comment: My stay at Olympic Hotel was perfect thanks to Hasan's excellent service. His professionalism and friendliness made the experience outstanding. Her open-eared, attentive and customer-focused approach to guests made my stay even more remarkable. It is truly commendable! 75. Comment: The hotel is truly wonderful, starting with the warm welcome at the reception. Receptionist Hasan Belpƒ±nar has been serving us since the first day and is a very friendly person. He was always there for us if we had any questions.||The rooms were very clean and thoroughly ‚Ä¶ 76. Comment: What I personally liked was that the staff were always helpful and answered any questions customers wanted to know, they were extremely reserved and discreet. You can have a good breakfast and the rooms were always clean which was good 77. Comment: This hotel has the friendliest staff I have ever met. Helpful, kind, polite and all around great. The hotel is in a fantastic location, close to shops, restaurants and all the magical places you would expect to see in this amazing city. The room was clean enough and the bed was comfortable but then again I'm not travelling thousands of miles to rot in a hotel room so it was perfectly fine to shower and rest my head for a few hours: showers, showers, the air con cooling and the lights on. Breakfast was very good, with plenty of fruit, cheese, meat, cereal, yoghurt and good coffee. Highly recommended, I loved my stay here and will definitely be back. 78. Comment: The hotel is normal for 3 stars, you can live there, the water is weak and lukewarm, there is no hot water. Breakfasts are tasty and more or less varied, not enough porridge or omelette but it's 3 stars so it's okay. It was a shame that they took all the towels the morning before departure day and left only one towel which we used for 4 days. It is not clear why they were not changed and in general the towels were not changed at all in 6 days. 79. Comment: The location of the hotel is absolutely fantastic. Being located in a central area makes it easy to explore the interesting places of Istanbul. The hotel is close to public transport and offers easy access to different parts of the city. There are also plenty of shopping opportunities and restaurants in the area. Unfortunately the rooms did not keep up with the hotel's excellent location. The rooms are dated and worn. The furniture can be renewed to provide guests with modern and attractive comfort. But the rooms were large enough. The staff are not unfriendly, but they are happy if you choose not to speak to them. The welcome and farewell leave much to be desired. 80. Comment: Location Horrific numbers. Not only were they small, but the bed in the double room was also small (one and a half). ‚Ä¶ 81. Comment: I was here in August 2023. The staff was wonderful and the room was stylish and clean. The breakfast was varied and delicious. The valet is friendly and fast. My family had a great time here, I think we will come back here. In conclusion, Istanbul Olympic Hotel is a 5 star hotel. 82. Comment: The location is very good, since the hotel is very central, it is very easy to reach everywhere. I came for the second time and was very pleased again. Very nice staff and service, which is very helpful. I will definitely come back here again when I want to visit Istanbul. 83. Comment: We had a nice stay of 10 nights, be sure to accept our request | Please book a room for a couple from April 20 to April 30 | We have fond memories of your welcome and let's not forget the nice breakfast in the morning. you soon. | 84. Comment: Hotel with unsafe rooms. Not recommended. This is our second time in Istanbul. It was not easy to reach this hotel. The small road in front of the hotel was closed to traffic so our driver couldn't find the perfect spot to stop. Finally, we went down to Muradiye Street, which was a very long way to the hotel. With our luggage in tow, it was a laborious walk through the crowded street and eventually an uphill climb to the hotel. We booked four rooms for 6 people for 7 nights. We were given rooms on the first, second and third floors. All the rooms were very small. The shower area is clogged and floods during shower due to blocked drain. 1. There was an unpleasant odor in the room on the first floor. 3. The water pressure in the room on the first floor was very weak. It was impossible to take a good shower. The rooms have no view. The windows open, revealing electrical shafts. Room soundproofing is poor. We can hear voices from the next rooms. The small elevator (lift) is suitable for 4 people and stops between floors. The elevator has 2 doors, but 1 door needs to be opened manually. There is no bellboy service and it was inconvenient to drag our luggage up or down the stairs. Not all rooms are secure as the door chains are very long and anyone can walk in and remove the door key or open the chain lock. The door switch is placed next to the door to activate the room lights. We tested this in every room and were able to remove the door chains and room keys. We took video of this as proof. At night, 2 of our rooms were disturbed by someone playing with the door handle. We had cai (tea) in the lobby but the reception staff tried to charge double the price when the real price of 20TL was clearly displayed on the board. The breakfast menu was the same every day except for 1 or 2 dishes. It was inconsistent in taste, some days being too harsh or salty. We paid 1200TL per room for late check-out and 1500TL for airport transfer. When we checked out, all our luggage was heavier because of all the shopping. It was a real struggle for us in the late 60s. When the housekeeping staff saw us leaving our rooms with suitcases, they offered no help and quickly disappeared. We regret choosing this hotel and would not recommend staying here. 85. Comment: We just returned from Istanbul and this hotel. It's okay for a few nights. The beds were good but don't say that the rooms looked clean and new and there was mold in the bathroom and the carpet was very dirty. Concrete floor to face the wall. Also the best place for city sightseeing. 86. Comment: I had a very nice experience there, especially with a receptionist named Hasan Bey who welcomed us warmly and was very helpful. I recommend it to everyone. A charming environment with wonderful staff, it is wonderful to visit such a hotel, I recommend everyone to come here and have a pleasant time. 87. Comment: It looks nice from the outside and the lobby but it is not. The staff needs a class in customer service. The rooms were so dirty! Carpet disgusting, shower moldy, sink dirty. The rooms are so small that it is hard to find space to open 2 suitcases. We did our own thing but then we couldn't get around the bed to the window. The room smelled of mold and mildew. The air conditioning was not working. A guy came and did something to the unit and all this dirty black water came out. It was so disgusting! Barat wasn't much help at the table. Also 3. He spoke loud enough to be heard on the floor. We asked for an extra pillow but it didn't come so we had to ask again. Sati at the desk was very helpful and nice. He was responsive when we had requests. Pros: good location and nice, soft beds. 88. Comment: We stayed at the hotel for 1-2 weeks. Extremely good for a 3 star hotel. Clean, our room was cleaned every day and linens and towels were changed too. The rooms are extremely small, but you're only coming here to sleep so it was fine. Breakfast is always automatically included for everyone, breakfast was good too. The location of the hotel is very central and you can walk everywhere. The employees were always very nice. If I came to Istanbul again, I would make a hotel reservation again. Very reliable and recommended. 89. Comment: The establishment is stuck in the 80s in terms of decoration. I don't think it's too much to ask for the (stained) carpet to be replaced, as well as the dusty curtains. We had to push the TV stand and unplug it to find an outlet. Radiator ‚Ä¶ 90. Comment: A very disappointing hotel. Even though it was around 13 degrees outside, the hotel was incredibly hot and stuffy. The room we eventually got was extremely small and sauna-like, the window faced a wall and outside the window were cigarettes and empty boxes from previous hotel guests. No sunlight came through the walls, so it was always dark. There was no water in the shower and many things were broken and missing, making it impossible to use the shower properly. Hotel staff (except cleaning staff) were unfriendly, not service oriented at all. Breakfast was comprehensive, but the coffee machine was broken. The only positive thing is the location, walking distance to all the tourist attractions. 91. Review: Clean room|Very nice staff|Central location|Easy to get to everywhere|Delicious breakfast|Very helpful reception who recommended us very good places.|Toilets were clean!!|No problems with cleaning staff|Simply great!!! 92. Comment: The hotel is very close to the famous mosques and other touristic places of Istanbul. The manager and other employees took very good care of us. The breakfast was great, it included all the traditional Turkish dishes and the accommodation was really good. 93. Comment: Quite a great hotel for a 3*. Responsive staff, they help with any questions (in English of course, they try to understand even if you don't know the language). Yes, the rooms are small, but they are just the right place to spend the night üëç ‚Äã‚Äãthe beds are soft, ‚Ä¶ 94. Comment: Value for money for a deluxe room was very good. We were greeted in a friendly and polite manner. The building where the deluxe rooms are located is located next to the main building with a separate entrance. The room was really big, the bed was comfortable and the silence was very relaxing. However, the bathroom was too small for my taste and it took some getting used to. All in all, this hotel is highly recommended at these prices. 95. Comment: Recommended. The quality/price ratio is very good. A special mention to the receptionist Hasan. It has a good location in the center of the city and is a very quiet and silent area at night, suitable for a good night's sleep. 96. Comment: Although there is air conditioning in the rooms, it does not work. It is very very hot inside the rooms. It is very noisy because you have to open the windows to get some ventilation and all the outside noise gets into the room. Worst accommodation ever. There is air conditioning in the rooms but it does not work. We were a group of 25 people and the air was not working in any of the rooms. Very noisy because we had to open the windows to get some air and all the noise goes into the rooms, worst nights. 97. Comment: I would give this hotel no stars if I could! The pictures have nothing to do with hotel rooms. The rooms are small, we could barely open two suitcases and since space was tight I ended up stepping on the room's trash can. The room smelled of smoke and the carpet was dirty. There was mold in the bathroom and the shower was clogged. The water was not draining and there was hair in the drain. We were disgusted with the room and glad our time there was over. The only positive aspect of the hotel was that it was centrally located and the staff was very polite. 98. Comment: THE MOST UNSAFE HOTEL I have never felt so unsafe in a hotel in my life! My mother and I were staying in one room and the hotel staff were entering our rooms at any time, especially at night, WITHOUT TAKING OUT THE MASTERKEY. When we protested they acted as if they didn't know English and also claimed that: they can enter any room they want whenever they want with the master key for cleaning purposes!! Extremely ill-mannered, unsafe and dangerous hotel staff! Even our room had a broken window, a bad smell and an uncleaned bathroom. They promised us they would change the room but needless to say, they didn't! Never stay at this hotel, especially women, because the hotel staff is ill-intentioned and there is no one to listen to your complaints. 99. Comment: Super good hotel, good opportunity in the heart of Sultan Ahmed and the Hagia Sophia mosque hotel staff are friendly people, if you have any questions you will receive the same good services. I returned home very satisfied. I recommend everyone to use it from their hotels. Sultan Ahmed Mosque is about five minutes' walk away. 100. Comment: WORST HOTEL EVER!! My daughter and I were staying in a room where we entered our rooms with the master keys many times whenever we wanted, even at night. WE HAVE NEVER FELT SO UNSAFE in a hotel in our entire lives! When we protested they acted like they didn't know English! All our complaints were in vain. EVEN AFTER OUR COMPLAINTS THEY CONTINUE TO ENTER OUR ROOM OVER AND OVER AGAIN.. Even the room was very bad, there was a bad smell, broken windows and uncleaned bathroom.. We were even promised that our room would be changed the next morning. but even that was not done! The staff is extremely bad-mannered, doesn't know how to talk civilly and thinks they can enter a room whenever they want without knocking on the door and using the master key for room cleaning purposes! What a disgusting excuse! I advise everyone, especially women, never to stay in this hotel!!.. The hotel staff is extremely disgusting and there is no one to listen to your complaints!.. 101. Comment: The hotel is very central‚Ä¶. best point.|Our bedroom was very small. Not enough space to store clothes.|Quite tired and in need of a makeover. The view from the window was terrible.|Breakfast was adequate. 102. Comment: He was there with his family. Good hotel, very centrally located, accessible to everything. Only two rooms were very narrow, and one had a window through which only one wall could be seen. It was a very dark room. Otherwise nice staff. Good service. He can speak English and German. Breakfast was also pretty good but there were few seats. 103. Comment: A good hotel to spend a few days in Istanbul. As for the perfect employees. The cleaning service was always very attentive, respectful and friendly. The receptionists were also friendly and in our case since we were in a large group they offered us activities with great discounts which enhanced the experience. And finally, breakfast is very diverse, rich and constantly replenished by the waiters. 104. Comment: After the very stylish and smart reception area, we were first shocked to see the room number 302 that was given to us. At best, it was a single room with a double bed squeezed into a corner against the wall. We asked to be moved and were given twin room 409. Both rooms looked dingy with old, stained carpets. It definitely needs decorating. But it wasn't that bad. The hotel has an excellent location, within a 10 to 15 minute walk of Topkapi, Hagia Sophia, Basilica Cistern shops and restaurants. Breakfast is continental style with cheese, ham, potatoes, boiled eggs, a few cereals, fruit, cakes and bread. Get down early, though. The rooms were kept as clean as possible by the very friendly and helpful staff. Can I stay here again? Hmmmm 105. Comment: The hotel is very good! The location is great! The rooms are small (but it doesn't matter), cleaned every day (towels, bathroom accessories (shampoo, shower gel, body cream), water - changed every day). There are historical places, tram, metro and port within walking distance. Breakfast option is not bad. The staff is polite, responsive and speaks fluent Russian. You can drink your own drinks at the reception. We are now in this hotel, we love everything! I recommend you to visit this hotel. 106. Comment: We were in room 5212 from 04/21/21 to 10/21/21. After checking into the room, we noticed that some plates were missing and a hotel representative came after us. When he saw us brewing tea in cups, without our will‚Ä¶ 107. Comment: ¬∑ This is not my first stay at this hotel, a review has been written.||Everything mentioned was provided in the best possible way.

The tram stop is nearby and there are places to eat. The room is very small but if you are only going to sleep it is okay.

The room wasn't big but the beds were comfortable, towels were changed every day, room cleaning wasn't perfect but it was also cleaned every day. day. Powerful hair dryer in the room ‚Ä¶ 111. Review: I stayed at this hotel from February 14 to 20, 2023, everything was great! First of all, many thanks to the welcoming staff! Those who take the time to explain when asking you a question, despite the slightly complicated language barrier! They are so kind, patient and welcoming! Especially the people at the reception and the room attendants! The hotel is very well located, 5 minutes walk from Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque! Very good service is provided by public transport. A metro stop is at the foot of the hotel. The metro is accessible until late (1 hour) into the tourist town so there is really no danger. Breakfast is varied and does its job very well. And the rooms are clean, they clean every day! Thank you again, I highly recommend it. 112.

Comment: Great location of the hotel. Lots of places and attractions within walking distance. The rooms are old and in need of renovation. Don't expect breakfast, there is nothing to eat, especially for a child. Good place to stay for two or three days to wander around the centre. 117. Comment: I don't understand who wrote super reviews about this hotel. maybe you live in a barn at home? The rooms are very small, cleaning consists of changing towels and making the beds. The water flow in the shower is barely running (a girl washing her hair‚Ä¶ 118. Comment: So the best thing about this hotel is that it is very central. The employees are nice. The rooms are very well arranged. Breakfast is totally ok. There is an elevator. The disadvantage is that you cannot enter the room with the elevator. I mean you have to go up the stairs afterwards. So you can't go into the room with the stroller, you have to leave it downstairs. Internet is available in the rooms. The rooms are a bit cramped and a bit old. But otherwise it's okay. As I said, good and cheap. You can't expect much for its price. Tamer G√∂lgesiz: Instagram 119. Comment: Very clean rooms, great WiFi, very close to all tourist attractions, very good knowledge of German, English and Russian I was here with my son for 8 days. The rooms were cleaned every day, towels were changed every day. 120. Comment: Close to Hagia Sophia, close to Top Kapa Palace, polite staff, money can be exchanged at reasonable prices at the reception, a variety of delicious breakfasts, the coffee machine makes excellent coffee with cream, on one side there is a street with cafes, on the other side there is a courtyard with tombs. The sound is loud, I heard noises from the neighbor's toilet in the morningüòÑ. Beds are made, bottles of drinking water are brought every day, shampoo and washing gels are brought every 2-3 days. You can ask for tea to your room, 7 lira, I gave 7 lira but he looked unhappy, probably wanted a tip. I am satisfied with the hotel. 121. Comment: Very very clean hotel. I'm really pleased. There were no problems. The breakfast was very tasty and fresh. There was a bottle of cold water in the refrigerator for each guest. The air conditioning worked very well, so you could sleep at a pleasant 21 degrees when the temperature outside was 35 degrees. The staff is very nice and helpful. Just around the corner was the ‚ÄúG√ºlhane‚Äù tram stop, which provided quick transportation to other places. In the end, I was very satisfiedüëçüèº 122. Comment: The hotel is in a very good location, close to the tram stop and many attractions. very small rooms, just tiny. Renewal required. Very good at cleaning‚Ä¶ 123. Comment: The hotel is as seen in the photos. It's small, the rooms are also quite small but it has everything you need and is very clean. |Disadvantage: we asked for a double bed and when we arrived there were two separate beds. When we say this at that time the couple ‚Ä¶ 124. Comment: Small, very clean hotel, exceptionally located between Emin√∂n√º, Sirkeci (left) and Sultanahmet (right), 10 minutes on foot or 1 tram stop but the walk is more enjoyable with shops on the way. Visiting all of Istanbul‚Ä¶ 125. Comment: I was pleased with my first experience at this hotel a few years ago. I went back in December 2021 and it was a completely different experience. The staff is rude except for the professional cleaning lady. Breakfast was included, but due to covid someone had to serve it to us. This person was so rude that we stopped coming for breakfast after the third day. Also, on New Year's Eve, drunk men knocked on my friend's and my room door several times in the middle of the night. I contacted the reception by phone, it took a long time to arrive, after an hour I had to come down and ask them directly to come. They said they would fix the problem but nothing was done. Luckily it was our last day because we felt safer there. 126. Comment: We visited this hotel in September 2021, the hotel was comfortable with its convenient location, quietness and good internet. The rooms were cleaned every day. We liked the breakfasts. Also, the hotel employee Hasan was always smiling, helped with the transfer to the airport, the price was lower than the neighboring travel agency 127. Comment: Hotel with super good location, basic visits can be done on foot (access to Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, Emin√∂n√º). The tram is also right next door. The hotel is simple but very clean, the staff is very friendly and ready for our requests and suggestions. 128. Comment: Great hotel, great owner, solves any problem! Breakfast is simple but suitable for every guest. The room is clean, spacious and bright! White towels and linens! The location is very good, everything is within walking distance! 129. Comment: We are on holiday with my wife and our 2 little daughters. Perfectly comfortable family room, smelled almost like a new, modern and spotlessly clean bathroom with at least 2m2 shower (felt like I was in a Turkish bath). The photo doesn't do it justice because the room is really big. ‚Ä¶ 130. Comment: The hotel was great. We were there for 6 nights. We previously had an interior room with a window, but it faced the well. We were allowed to look at another room upon request and if we liked it better we were allowed to take this one. We decided on the new room because the window faced the street. Both rooms were very clean. Small but beautiful. The bed and mattress were amazing. I slept like I was on a cloud. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Our rooms were always cleaned. Simply hang the door sign you want cleaned. People who complain about their rooms not being cleaned here must have forgotten the sign. Everything is on your doorstep. Incredibly good. I can't say anything about breakfast because we were eating out all the time. We wanted to get service :) We were there from January 2 to January 8, 2019 and saw how it looked yesterday in November with empty rooms. So what can I say? One just gives a thumbs up. 131. Comment: A magnificent hotel in the heart of Fatih. It is very close to important tourist attractions such as Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia and the Grand Bazaar. The price was very reasonable as it included breakfast. Breakfast was very good for the price. The cleaning was very good, the room was very clean and the beds were very comfortable. The bathroom was a little cramped but it wasn't a problem for me. I will come back to this hotel next time I visit Istanbul. It was a great experience 132. Comment: Welcoming, helpful staff. The rooms are a bit narrow but well-maintained. The restaurant is good. The location is great!!! The value for money is there. Let's not forget that this is Istanbul üòâ ‚Ä¶ 133. Comment: Best hotel. Very friendly staff. Clean. Highly recommended. Breakfast with a view of Istanbul. Great center. Everything is reachable on foot. If you are looking for a central and clean hotel this is the right place. 134. Comment: The hotel is in the centre, a few hundred metres from the Sultanahmet Mosque and Hagia Sophia, reasonable prices and very friendly, social and helpful staff... I was in Istanbul with my wife on Christmas and the day after Christmas and in general I can say this. ‚Ä¶ 135. Comment: Rooms were very small for a double room. The elevator and the room are not on the same level. You have to carry your luggage for 6-7 steps, which gives you a headache. The elevator is very small, only two people can stand in it at a time and only one person can stand if you have luggage. 136. Comment: I repeat absolutely, an unbeatable location, very central but at the same time quiet, you can walk to the main points of interest, there is even a tram stop just one street away. The staff was very kind and willing to help with anything. The first night the air didn't work very well and they immediately sent a technician to fix the problem. Excellent hotel 137. Comment: It took me a long time to choose a hotel and I was not wrong. The hotel was left alone +. I loved absolutely everything, even the very small rooms (it was very annoying the first day, then I got used to it). The location is ideal for a touristic holiday. Everything is within walking distance: ‚Ä¶ 138. Comment: The location is very good, close to Hagia Sophia Topkapi Palace, Archaeological Museum and Topkapi Park. The rooms are very clean and covid_safe. Delicious food and breakfast, good price quality and excellent room service with excellent food and good taxi service. Transfer services. Friendly service 139. Review: Fantastic Location 6 minutes walk from Hagia Sophia Hotel Room is good - good space to get in, store your luggage and move around. The rooms could be larger and quieter. The bed needs to be more comfortable 140. Comment: The staff is friendly and helpful to their customers. The restaurant is good. The rooms are well maintained, a bit tight for a couple but you get your money's worth. This is Istanbul. I'm glad 141. Comment: I stayed at this hotel in the month of July/2022 now. Excellent location, good, clean room, good breakfast and excellent service from both receptionists and staff. I would like to underline Hasan Bey's excellent attention and care, he helped me a lot during my stay in Istanbul, a city I will visit again one day. 142. Comment: Very good hotel. Correct Normal sized room. In fact, there are stains on the carpet as some comments have stated. Good beds. Dressing table, bedside table, wardrobe, armchair Prayer rugs available on site, bath shower cream shampoo samples... Breakfast is good and varied. Fruit juice, tea, coffee, latte, eggs, bread, bagels, fruits, vegetables, raw vegetables, pastries... vs. The people are very friendly. Do not speak French. It is better to know English or Turkish at a basic level. The restaurant right across from Olive Extra!!! Great service and gourmet food. 143. Comment: I stayed only one night at this hotel, the location is perfect for visiting the city centre. The rooms are clean but small, mine in particular smelled badly of cigarette smoke (perhaps not to disprove the saying "I smoke like a Turk"). Kabul ‚Ä¶ 144. Comment: Recommended for location only. The weather wasn't working very well. It made perfect sense, although most of them are like that, there are some that are more comfortable. Do not exchange money near the hotel, the exchange rate varies. Do not buy souvenirs and do not eat near the hotel, it is more expensive. 145. Comment: Very good hotel, close to the old city, Gulhane Park, tram station, ferry, marmaris station|Sultanahmet,|Very nice tasty breakfast|Small rooms|Affordable prices|We can make a reservation by phone |Reception and all staff are good.. Thank you all 146. Comment: The hotel is located in an excellent location. The neighborhood is quiet, clean, safe and well connected to the metro and central points. The hotel is small but clean. The only downsides are the small rooms with no view and the breakfast served underground. I would go back anyway. Friendly helpful staff. 147. Comment: Nice and clean hotel. Rooms are cleaned daily even if you don't leave your room until 3am :). The location of the hotel is good, everything is within walking distance. The staff is friendly. I will definitely be returning here in the future. 148. Comment: Even one star is too much. The hotel is a complete disaster. We made a reservation for 6 nights and were warmly received, but the rooms had nothing to do with the pictures. As I mentioned, I must have looked at 4-5 more rooms but none of them looked like the pictures. The only good thing was that we were very central but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, it's just crap. 149. Comment: I stayed at this hotel for 20 days, I am more than satisfied with their service! Cleanliness is at the highest level, the receptionists are always attentive and welcoming and at our service, the Yater maid does a great job, the location is perfect, close to the tram stop and a few meters walk from the metro, aya sophia and the Sultanahmet Mosque and the Grand Bazaar, I honestly recommend this hotel with my eyes closed, thank you to the whole team 150. Comment: Olympic is a hotel located in the historical center of Istanbul, a few steps from Topkapi Palace, Hagia Sophia, Sultanahmet Mosque and Basilica Cistern. There are also public transport options that allow you to easily explore the city, as well as bars, ‚Ä¶ 151. Comment: A decent hotel in the Sultanhamet district, in the centre of Istanbul. All tourist attractions of the city are within walking distance; Sultanahmet Mosque, Hagia Sophia Mosque, Top Cana Palace, Hippodrome Square. It is important that the hotel is located on a small street with no public transport. There is no noise. Very friendly staff. The breakfasts are delicious and filling. The chef is also very friendly.) The disadvantage is that there are economy rooms with windows facing the wall. 152. Comment: Thank you for being with us every time we stay in Istanbul. ||It is a very convenient base for wandering around the old city. ||The tram station is nearby, making it easy to go to the Grand Bazaar or the new city. ||June ‚Ä¶ 153. Comment: The hotel is in a great location, next to the G√ºlhane tram stop and perfect for any journey on foot! Spotless rooms and bathrooms, perfect for a 4 night stay.. Everyone at the reception was so kind, they gave us lots of advice! Single ‚Ä¶ 154. Comment: Very nice budget hotel. Very clean. 6. Rooms on the first floor have beautiful views of the city. The staff is very friendly and very knowledgeable. Some rooms are small but staff are willing to change rooms - just ask. Very convenient for transport connections. We stayed from December 3-8, 2015 and had a wonderful stay. Would definitely stay again. Use of the spa requires an agreement with the sister hotel opposite - it should be free! 155. Comment: The hotel is spotlessly clean. The welcome was great üëçüëçüëçüëçüëç. The location is great, we do all our visits within 500 meters. I really recommend it for anyone visiting Istanbul. There is a restaurant on every street corner. If you want to see the markets of Istanbul, the tram station is 50 meters away‚Ä¶ 156. Comment: The hotel is ideal for a short trip. Room service (hot meals) is available even within 1 hour. Breakfast was good, standard. The rooms are a bit small but clean. Excellent location, lively, lots of shops, restaurants etc. Many attractions can be reached on foot, the tram is 1 minute walk away. I would book the hotel again. 157. Comment: The hotel is great for a triple, clean, well maintained, they took into account the request for 2 separate beds, the room is warm, despite the beginning of March they always opened the windows - it was stuffy, the bathroom has heated floors, also unlike triples in Italy there are disposable slippers. There is enough space in the room, the view from the window was terrible but there was no time to look there, at 6.30 am if the windows are open the imams will wake you up - there are many mosques around. Breakfast from seven in the morning - mediocre coffee, tea, powdered juice, eggs, potatoes, tomatoes, cucumbers, greens, strange sausages, 3-4 types of cheese, olives, jam and a bunch of buns. The hotel has an excellent location - the archaeological museum is a 5-minute walk away (it is better to buy a museum pass), while Topkapi and Sultanahmet Square are a pleasant 15-minute walk away. There is a tram stop right next to it (it is better to buy an Istanbulcard and top it up immediately, the benefit is twice as much). 158. Review: This hotel was small but very clean and had internet in our room - both things that were invaluable on our trip. The location is perfect, we easily walked around the spice souk, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, walked to the Grand Bazaar (which was a bit of a walk up the hill), but the whole city is easily accessible thanks to the tram stop right next door. hotel. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful, especially when trying to sort out our transportation to the airport. Would definitely stay here again. 159. Comment: Hotel staff is very helpful, especially Siddik, Hasan and Burak. They were very kind and helpful, thank you guys. Breakfast was very good. The location is perfect, all touristic attractions in Sultan Ahmed and Amin√∂n√º can be reached by foot. Transportation (metro, train, tram, ferry and bus) can be easily reached on foot. Me and my family had a great time there 160. Comment: Everything was very good. The staff is very friendly. The rooms were very clean (which I think is the most important thing). We didn't have any experience with food because we only ate outside the hotel. By the way, we highly recommend the nearby Resto Han (food). 161. Comment: Good hotel. Nearby are all the palaces and a tram stop. Gulhane Park is across the road. The cafes are cheap and the wonderful Olivia restaurant is next door. Very good breakfasts and lunches. Fruits, cheeses, two types of hot dishes, pastries, rich menu. Everything is very fresh and delicious. We had enough for the whole day. 162. Comment: Small, very clean hotel, exceptionally located between Emin√∂n√º, Sirkeci (left) and Sultanahmet (right), 10 minutes on foot or 1 tram stop but the walk is more enjoyable with shops on the way. It is perfect for visiting all of Istanbul because the T1 tram (it is a long line) G√ºlhane stop is right next to the hotel. The staff is very friendly, smiling and helpful. 163. Review: Excellent Location and great value for money; breakfast is ok and family room is fine for couple with 2 kids! 164. Comment: This is a two star hotel, not a three star. Great place. Very noisy due to proximity of tram 165. Review: The worst experience I've ever had in a hotel! I booked this hotel based on positive reviews! It was a horror! The room was so small that our suitcases barely fit! The pictures give you a completely different picture! Service disaster! We booked a tour to Bursa but the receptionist messed it up! The next day we had to wait over an hour for our driver. Our fridge wasn't filled with water! Our laundry was not washed 3 times! We told the reception that this was not the first time this had happened. They assured me it would be done the next day. But it still wasn't done! We then had to hand our laundry over to reception ourselves so it could be sorted out! We wanted to do our laundry two days before we left! It was never done again and instead of making up for their mistake the receptionist said "Take your laundry to a local laundromat!" I should run to the laundromat instead of coming towards us! What a bad service this is! 166. Comment: We were at this hotel from 01.10 to 04. 10.2020. I liked everything, excellent service, rooms although small are comfortable and have everything you need. Daily cleaning, varied breakfasts, walking distance to tourist attractions. Thank you to the staff for your care and attention! Thank you! 167. Comment: We want to leave an honest and most importantly positive review about the Olympiat hotel and the hotels of this chain because we are visiting for the second time and visited the restaurants and the bath of the hotel, which left a feeling of love for everyone who attendedüëç so ‚Ä¶ 168. Comment: Super friendly and helpful staff, not far from the Grand Bazaar, Blue Mosque and Hagia Sophia. Appetizing lunch. very very clean, come and visit, you will not be disappointed, because the tram is always available. 169. Comment: The hotel is located in the very centre of the Old Town, surrounded by many tourist attractions. But this also has its drawbacks - prices in cafes and restaurants, in shops are exorbitant. ‚Ä¶ 170. Comment: The location of the hotel is excellent, all tourist attractions are within walking distance. It's generally clean, but that's hard to tell in a 3x3 room where most of the space is taken up by the bed. ‚Ä¶ 171. Comment: My wife and I stayed in Istanbul for 2 nights. ||You can walk to any point in the old town and the proximity to the tram station makes it a perfect place for sightseeing. ||Soup and dishes for breakfast change every day and are very ‚Ä¶ 172. Comment: Small, basic hotel but very well located, close to main attractions and tram line. Reception service is only reasonable. The double rooms facing the street are small; two suitcases would make the room almost impassable anyway‚Ä¶ 173. Comment: Small rooms, I mean very small. What's wrong with WiFi? Not possible. It's better to cut it during breaks.||And there's no breakfast buffet. Distributed by a local person (chief? (The pastry chef?) We encountered his bad mood and it also affected us‚Ä¶ 174. Comment: The tram station is also very close by, so if you walk to the right you can go to the old city and the Grand Bazaar, if you walk to the left you can go to the Spice Bazaar and the ferry terminal, which makes this hotel very convenient for sightseeing. ||Outside the window‚Ä¶ 175. Review: A great hotel in a great location. Nearby tram stop T1 is 10 minutes from Eminem and Galata Bridge and Hagia Sophia. The rooms are very small. Breakfast is excellent, lots of options. I recommend! 176. Comment: Small hotel in the old town. Very simple rooms overall. Most of the time the front desk staff was away. The breakfast buffet is inadequate compared to other hotels we stayed in Turkey. 177. Comment: Very clean, practical hotel, welcoming staff. Its biggest flaw is the persistent smell of cigarette smoke that prevails in the hall, in the hotel and sometimes even in the bathrooms due to the ventilation system... Even though we had non-smoking rooms, there was a lingering tobacco smell. Damage. Ideal for those who travel light, if you have multiple heavy luggage, a stroller or a wheelchair it will be difficult to move them around... (you still have to climb stairs to get to your floor since the elevators are located between floors.) rooms aren't great (you can hear neighbors and surrounding activity). Otherwise it is in a very good location. There are many restaurants and shops in the surrounding area. The tram stop is a few meters away. Topkapi too. Perfect level of closeness. The ability to do everything on foot. 178. Comment: Located in the centre of Izmir, a 5-minute walk from Pasmane Train Station. The surrounding streets are side streets with a pleasant atmosphere. The staff was courteous and I felt comfortable. Rooms are average and cheap travel‚Ä¶ 179. Comment: We stayed at this hotel during our recent trip to Istanbul. It was a very good experience. The check-in process was very smooth. The room was very spacious, especially as we are from England. It was clean and well-maintained. Free wifi was available for use. Breakfast was included in the package; the menu was typical Turkish but the options were much more limited than what is offered in Cappadocia. The staff at the reception was very cooperative. We went to Kayseri for one night but they kept our extra luggage in the luggage room free of charge. We even left one of our mobile phones in the room. They were kind enough to call us back to let us know about it and returned it when we returned. Honesty at its best! The hotel is ideally located in the heart of Sultanahmet. Metro/tram station is barely 2 minutes away. Hagia Sophia and the Blue Mosque are less than a 10-minute walk away. There are many restaurants in the immediate vicinity of the hotel. 180. Comment: Very convenient location. There are many attractions nearby, convenient transport links, tram and metro. The rooms are small, smell of smoke and are a bit shabby. Breakfasts are filling. If you use it as intended, it is quite suitable if you spend the night and go for a walk all day. The staff is friendly. 181. Comment: Great location, I must say. 1 minute to tram. After a few minutes the sea can be seen. Nice gentlemen at the front desk. There is no luggage service!!! So carry your luggage yourself first. The gentleman at the reception without a name tag could have been more polite and greeted the guests! I can only recommend the family room, super spacious, cleanliness is great. Have fun in Istanbul 182. Comment: Excellent location - in the centre of the historic Fatih district. All tourist attractions on the European side of Istanbul are within walking distance. Friendly staff. Towels are changed every day. Among the shortcomings is unstable wi-fi. 183. Comment: I came to stay here for a week with my mother, sister and nephew. We return with very good memories. Located close to everything. As a group of women, we felt very safe. A simple but delicious breakfast. Clean rooms, last ‚Ä¶ 184. Comment: With the excitement of traveling abroad alone for the first time, I took my huge suitcase, got off the tram and headed towards the hotel. Just as I was about to struggle with the unexpected cobblestone road, I arrived at the hotel and was really grateful that I had chosen this hotel‚Ä¶ 185. Comment: I can't change the star rating but it's more than 2 1/2. The location is good but the heating in the room cannot be controlled so it is quite hot at night. And someone started drilling into the next room at 9:15 in the morning. Besides that, it was good. Small room but nice Staff. Slow internet. 186. Comment: The location is great. All historical sites are within walking distance. The rooms are clean but small. Some rooms smell of cigarette smoke. You must inform us in advance that you are given a non-smoking room. The staff is friendly. The breakfast is good. 187. Comment: The hotel is well located and within easy reach of major tourist attractions. Its disadvantage is that it shares a border with a cemetery and alcohol is served there. Especially the windows of the family room on the ground floor open onto the cemetery. 188. Comment: Air conditioning does not work, cannot be set to 22 or 24 or 25 degrees, preset to 27 degrees, this is very hot, we are all SWEATING and are making this review after speaking to the reception. He said he couldn't do anything about it. The location is good but there are 50 hotels in these 5 parallel lanes and they are all close to the G√ºlhane tram stop. 189. Comment: Trip arrival date December 30 - January 6, 2020 Unfortunately, we were not satisfied with the hotel and do not recommend it to anyone. Reception was not friendly upon arrival, we had to wait 5 hours for our 3 bed room.. Once we were allowed to go to our room we weren't even asked if we needed help with our luggage... unfriendly! The rooms were too small for 3 people... The carpets in the room were very dirty (old stains that you can't remove) need to be replaced. When we asked at the reception, we were told that everything was full and there was no solution. Unfortunately, this room was for 2 people, not 3. You have to find a solution and not squeeze the guests for the money you pay. Breakfast was a disaster 1. very few options. 2. Once it runs out it takes a very long time to refill. 3. The room's tables are placed too close together. 4. There are too few tables in the room. Maximum 0.10 time. 5. Breakfast didn't taste good either, 2 types of cheese, 2 types of salami, butter, honey, muesli, probably changed 3 years ago and doesn't look clean anymore, the only positive thing was the bread selection.. What to do is not yet complete. At the lobby, the reception staff doesn't even greet you (gentleman who is always there in the morning) WHAT WE LIKED HERE WAS THE CLEANING STAFF WHO ASKED IF EVERYTHING WAS OK, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING, HOW YOU ARE, IF THE ROOMS ARE OK (THE MAN ALWAYS STAFF ON THE UPPER FLOOR 6TH. (HE WAS CLEANING THE FLOOR) CONTINUE üëç! The food is very good and delicious with room service that you can order from the hotel next door..üëç After checking out, we could have asked if we needed help with our luggage. NO, that was not asked either.. Is everything ok so far? The hotel owner must find a solution! Then look for another hotel where you will feel comfortable! 190. Comment: Rooms are very small, but for someone on a budget it is within walking distance of restaurants, shops, the metro, as well as monuments such as Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, the Cistern, and the Obelisk. Ideal for short-term stays. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the prices are straightforward, Wi-Fi is included, and the rooms are clean. I needed extra time in my room and they were kind enough to charge me half a day. The daily fee is 40 Euros. 191. Comment: Location Horrific numbers. Not only were they small, but the bed in the double room was also small (one and a half). ‚Ä¶ 192. Comment: Great hotel. The location is close to the center, the cleanliness is good, the breakfast is satisfactory. There is nothing to complain about. The only minus for picky eaters was that the reception did not speak Chinese fluently. 193. Comment: A really good hotel in the best location of Istanbul! The service is very good - special mention to Hasan at the reception! He is very friendly and extremely helpful! 194. Comment: This hotel in the heart of Sultanahmet district has 2. accomodation. Excellent value for money, very simple services and always clean. I recommend you to visit Istanbul! 195. Comment: The rooms are very narrow and the air conditioning is very hot. We only stayed one day and left. As for its advantages; it is a street full of markets and restaurants. tourism offices and banks. 196. Comment: The tram that makes it easy to reach the airport is a 3-minute walk away and there are many attractions nearby, such as Topkapi Palace, so you can easily get around using this hotel as a base. |Also open buffet breakfast ‚Ä¶ 197. Comment: We stayed for a week with a group of 33 people and the hotel was clean, very central, very comfortable and the staff were very friendly. We have no complaints. There is also a very long breakfast program and a lot of variety. 198. Comment: The location of the hotel is really good, you can reach many places in a very short time. The room we had was very good and uncle Hasan at the reception helped us a lot and he also speaks German. 199. Comment: Olympic hotel is a perfect compromise for those who want to stay in Istanbul for 4/5 days or a week. Its location is perfect as it is right in the centre of all the touristic and historical places to visit. ‚Ä¶ 200. Comment: Everything was perfect, they put a soft pillow and a hard pillow, the rooms were well cleaned, the staff at the reception people were very nice and very friendly, honestly I will come back 201. Comment: The location is right in the centre, you can reach all important places with the S-Bahn. Hagia Sophia, Sultanahmet Mosque, Top Kapi Palace, Kapanicarsi... The service was great, the staff helpful the area only got 3 stars, the room was too small for my taste. 202. Comment: Located in the centre of Istanbul. Very convenient. The staff is polite. Breakfast is included in your stay - everything is always fresh, a good choice and delicious. The rooms are small but everything is clean and tidy. 203. Comment: The hotel itself is very good, the beds are very comfortable and the service is also very professional and they help you with anything you need. Add to that the fact that you can walk to almost every important place in Istanbul. 204. Comment: A very good hotel in the centre of everything Fatih is known for, with very attentive staff. Comfortable rooms. Recommended. Close to typical venues' shops, grand bazaar, spice market and Bosphorus. Close to many tourist attractions, cheap, good cleaning and good breakfast 205. Review: I stayed there for about 5 nights in April 2015. Even though my English is not good, they helped me a lot with tour reservations and luggage storage. Also the location was very good and convenient to go anywhere for sightseeing. The room was clean and comfortable. 206. Comment: Rooms are dirty, sheets are not changed, vacuum cleaner is not used, no water in bathrooms. Half the people at this hotel are rude. The buffet is not a buffet, the host who takes care of it is unpleasant. Nobody speaks French 207. Comment: A commendable service for this hotel in the centre of Istanbul. I was very pleased. Extremely friendly staff, excellent and plentiful breakfast buffet. Clean and quiet rooms a stone's throw from Hagia Sophia and Blue Flies 208. Comment: Get off at G√ºlhane station, enter the side street perpendicular to the tram stop, turn right, you will see it. I arrived on an early morning flight, dropped off my luggage at the hotel around 7am, explored the surrounding attractions and checked in‚Ä¶ 209. Comment: A good hotel with excellent location, quiet atmosphere, proximity to the street and tram. Varied buffet breakfast. Good attention from the person. 210. Comment: The rooms are a bit worn and old looking but have all the necessary amenities. Good breakfast. 211. Comment: The hotel looked good and was also clean but the staff could have tried harder to look after their guests. We had a room without air conditioning, the weather was very hot, unfortunately the toilet light was broken. 212. Comment: The hotel has a very good location. Close to main attractions, close to tram line, close to good restaurants. Breakfast is reasonable and there is something wrong with the rooms. The elevator does not stop on the floor where the bedroom is located, you have to climb the stairs. 213. Comment: We were there in December. Everything is pretty good. Modest but well-mannered. Breakfast is not for the picky. The staff was polite, especially the receptionist. All major tourist attractions are within easy reach. 214. Comment: Friendly staff. Always there if you need anything. A very hygienic hotel!! The breakfast was excellent. The tram didn't bother us anyway. It is also a multi-location destination, you can get to anywhere you want to be. 215. Comment: It is nicely located, it makes a very bright and clean impression, but staying in a room without light (the window opens to the wall) and the fact that the bathroom (although squeaky clean) smelled as if a corpse was rotting was unpleasant, to put it briefly. I complained and was offered another room but let it slide - another unfortunate solo traveller would no doubt fall into this hole! 216. Comment: The location is in the museum center of the city.
