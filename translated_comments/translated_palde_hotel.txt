1. Comment: The only good thing about the hotel is its location, the rooms do not look like the pictures! The room we got did not have working air conditioning. The door handle didn't close and the towels were stained. The evening receptionist's behavior was terrible, I paid extra 90 euros for breakfast... 2. Comment: Very good hotel. The hotel owner and staff are friendly, the diction is good, the accommodation is excellent, the breakfasts are delicious, the floor staff are all friendly and helpful, I recommend the hotel, it is a very good hotel 3. Comment: I have never seen such a disgrace in my life. The business owner and the staff swore at us and asked why we locked the locker room door. I have never seen such nonsense in my life. I would never recommend it to anyone. It is a complete disgrace. Comment: The owner is a complete idiot. After swimming, we went to change our clothes and locked our door. He swore at us saying it was forbidden to lock, but we couldn't catch him. Don't worry, the whole street knows us, we'll run into him 5. Comment: It's not worth making a reservation, think well when renting this place, it's disrespectful and uninteresting. 6. Comment: Two people We stayed at the hotel for a few nights. The hotel manager and other employees are very attentive. Breakfast was open buffet, and it was enough for us. Hygiene is very important to us. The hotel itself and the rooms were very clean. The bed linens, towels, the room itself and the bathroom were very clean. We stayed with peace of mind. We will definitely be back again! 7. Comment: They said it was a taxi belonging to the hotel and charged 600 TL. We learned from the taxi driver that the taxi driver charged 375 TL and the remaining 225 TL was shared between the bellboy and the receptionist and he asked us to complain. It is very sad that this situation occurs in such an institution. Comment: The location of the hotel is in a very good spot. The staff is friendly and the breakfast is varied and delicious. The spa section is in regular flow. Clean, spacious and daily disinfected rooms. Thank you very much for your interest and attention. 9. Comment: Very nice and clean hotel. Moreover, it is in Sirkeci, the historical and touristic center of the city. Marmaray, tram, ship and IETT in 100 steps. The spa is very nice and the people are competent. Pool sauna salt room Turkish bath clean Staff attentive, knowledgeable and helpful What else would you expect from a hotel in the heart of the city? Everything is there and close to perfect 10. Yorum: don't believe all the good reviews are fake its employees are a complete bandit, disrespectful and it is inevitable that you will have a terrible day, something can go wrong at any moment, your life safety is in danger. Don't believe all the good comments, they are fake. Their employees are complete thugs, disrespectful and you are bound to have a terrible day, something can go wrong at any moment, your life is in danger. 11. Comment: My old employee who works there did not give me 900 TL. The stingy and deceitful reactions that took advantage of the employee's rights did not give my friend 12 thousand TL. I leave it to Allah, he will get many times more than 12. Comment: I don't know about the hotel part, but the spa part is a complete fiasco. First of all, anyone from outside can enter the pool area in the spa area with their shoes on, which is not hygienic at all. They take the money in advance but the sauna part does not work. The manager of the spa department is someone named partridge, pigeon (the hotel owner calls him that, I don't know if it's his name or nickname) who can change the hours as he wishes and turn your massage time into a neighborhood bathhouse fight when it's his convenience. disrespect, amateurism knee-high 13. Comment: All the positive comments here are fake. They want your phone number to leave a positive comment. Breakfasts are stale and 3 days old. Be careful about scams, something can be stolen from your room at any time. FAKE a hotel with fake positive reviews, fraud and theft 14. Comment: We had a very nice stay during our 3-day trip to Istanbul with my wife. The staff's attention, breakfast, and meals were all very nice. I definitely recommend it. Our new home in Istanbul from now on :) 15. Comment: We checked into the hotel at 03:30 on August 30th. My family and I were very helpful when we arrived at the reception at night. Thank you very much . The location is great in a central location. The cleaning is very good. Thank you, the service you provide is great. 16. Comment: Thank you very much for the comfort and service you added to our 10-day Istanbul trip with your magnificent serviceüôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The cleanliness of the rooms, the variety in the breakfast, the attention and concern of your employees, both Ula≈ü Bey and our oppressed brother, made us feel like we were in our own home, thank you.. You are now the only address we can trust without question.‚òòÔ∏è 17. Comment: I reserved a room 2 months ago. 20 days before the last one they said the price was wrong, 600 TL. They asked for too much, I accepted. Not entering the hotel with 12 hours left. 1500 TL. They wanted extra. When I refused, they cancelled the room. Be careful, they increase the price every day. If I didn't call on the last day, I wouldn't even know I was coming tomorrow. They didn't even give notice. So be careful. 18. Comment: Congratulations, it is a very well-trained hotel with really well-organized staff. They offered us private airport vehicles at affordable prices, Istanbul tours, boat tours at very nice and discounted prices. Cleaning is done meticulously daily. Hope to see you again üôè 19.

The staff is family-friendly, clean, the rooms are very comfortable and luxurious. The owner of the hotel welcomed us very warmly. They took care of everything for us until the day we left. Thank you Paldƒ±r family, we will come again on the 25th. Comment: The hotel is very dirty and poorly maintained. I regret coming. My room smelled of cigarette smoke and the walls were so thin you could hear whatever was being said in the next room. I would never choose 26 again. Comment: The hotel is in the most beautiful location of Sirkeci. I also saw that the staff and managers really do their job properly. I would like to thank each and every one of them. And I hope to see you again soon. 27. Comment: This hotel is really good. We would especially like to thank Mr. Furkan and Mr. Ugur. They are very caring and friendly! 28.

The breakfast is very good. There is a swimming pool and sauna. The staff takes care of everything. 32. Comment: The location is central but the staff service is on the level.

Comment: Nice hotel 84. Comment: Everything is fine 85. Comment: Nothing in total. The location of the photo is in the hotel. Completely camera footage lijken anders anchor, ongelofelijk. Erg klein, this toilet door smells bad. Cameras can be removed from your phone. When receiving a message from a person who is not in the bedroom the whole person does not have a contact in the reception area. I also have more children than anyone else. We had no choice but to stay at the hotel. There is no more than one person in your hotel. Definitely not recommended. I think the photos were taken from another hotel. The rooms look completely different, it's unbelievable how dirty the room is. It's too small, plus it doesn't go through the toilet, the bathroom smells too much. Moldy and damp rooms. The staff is not friendly at all, the guy at the reception yelled at my dad because he asked for new bedding. If the room has never been cleaned, you will see hair everywhere. We couldn't stay but checked out the same day and looked for another hotel. 1 star is too much for such a hotel. Definitely not recommended. I think the photos were taken from another hotel.

We couldn't even stay one night, so we checked out the same day and looked for another hotel. One star is too much for such a hotel 86. Comment: Super not recommended. The room with a broken toilet and toilet was requested several times but no solution was found, we stayed for three days with a broken toilet. They only cleaned our room once because according to them the cleaning staff was not there; they did not leave us towels and we had to ask, not from the hotel line, they gave us others because we ran out of towels. It is not a very serious team. Everything reflects a 2 star hotel, not a 4 star hotel. Sauna and spa costs ‚Ç¨15 per person per day and are not free of charge. 87. Comment: ESCAPING from the hotel!!! Very very dirty hotel, bathroom does not match the pictures (holes in tiles, mold on joints and mold in shower) The first day we arrived at the hotel our bed was very dirty with urine, feces or blood stains‚Ä¶ on the bed and blankets were full of uncleaned urine or feces stains. We had to change everything but unfortunately despite the change the blanket was still dirty. When you want to clean your room they only make the bed and they don't give you toilet paper or new towels, you have to ask them to get them, the worst thing is they don't clean your bathroom or your room. the floor remains dirty... despite the person who came to clean the room... The staff is unpleasant!!! TO VOMIT they say neither hello nor goodbye, they get angry immediately when you ask for a service. We had to ask for the air conditioner to be fixed every day because it was not working. The photos are definitely not true to life. The only positive point was the location but having a great location and a very bad and very dirty, UNLIVABLE hotel was definitely not worth it. It was chosen as the worst hotel, it doesn't even deserve 1 star. This is a constructive comment, see other comments that share the same opinion. 88. Comment: So we traveled to Istanbul for a few days. There were 8 of us. When we arrived at the hotel they told us that the room was not ready and advised us to come back in an hour. We came back an hour later, they said there were no vacancies but they immediately put us in ‚Ä¶ 89. Comment: Avoid this hotel! The staff is rude, the breakfast is terrible, the hotel is dirty and the restaurants in the area are much more expensive than other areas despite being close to everything. I was initially hoping the hotel would be better than the reviews said but the online reviews are so accurate. Our group booked 4 bedrooms (2x suites and 2x deluxe). Upon check-in, we were told that the rooms were not ready yet, which was more than okay since we were early. However when we came back we were told that 2 floors were closed and we would have to stay the first night at their second hotel (Savone Hotel & Spa) and have the option to stay there or move out the next day. Free spa access is offered. The next day they told me that the suites were not ready until the next day. They let us see the normal rooms and the rooms are not in good condition especially the bathroom. In the end we decided to stay at the other hotel. Compared to the other hotel we stayed at (Savone), the staff is much nicer. However, the cleanliness is very poor and the service speed is extremely slow. We were given rooms and one of them wasn't even ready and the other room didn't have any curtains. The lack of curtains wouldn't normally be a problem, but the window looked out onto a courtyard with direct access to the room windows. This was fixed the next day. Of the 4 rooms we had, every room had an issue such as hot fridge, bad shower drainage, stained sheets, broken shower head. If you want anything, you will have to do a few follow-ups to get it. The doors are so thin that you can hear everything from your room. Security and safety at both hotels are highly questionable. Anyone can walk in and pass the reception. In Savone, the stairs are full of trash, cleaning equipment and laundry and sometimes 1. Stair access from the floor is blocked. They offered a free airport transfer to make up for this but we decided against it as it was ultimately very hard to trust them. Do not book either hotel unless you have no other option. 90. Comment: The only good thing about the hotel is its location. One of the staff members was very rude and unapologetic. He was treating women badly and shouting at them. Very very bad attitude and disrespect towards many guests. There were issues with WiFi and room service was not available daily. We stayed for 4 days. We had to call and speak to reception several times for something simple like water bottles. There is no lamp in the room, so we have to sleep in complete darkness. Overall, there are plenty of good options to choose from, so head elsewhere on the same street, 91st. Comment: So we traveled to Istanbul for a few days. There were 8 of us. When we arrived at the hotel they told us that the room was not ready and advised us to come back in an hour. We came back after an hour, they said there were no vacancies but they would move us to another hotel just around the corner called Savone Hotel and promised to move us back to Palde the next day. The room was fine, big enough but there was nothing to complain about. Stains on sheets, overhead shower was like a fountain, not enough toilet roll (asked for another, none available), view outside room was like an abandoned building, cleaning supplies very scattered on stairs, wall was so thin you could hear people outside the room, no bedside lamp, towels were very old and 2. They were not asked to clean the room daily. The next day came, there was still no room in Palde. We paid for 2 large rooms and a deluxe. My sister kept following what the story was but there is still no room and they can't accommodate us. They gave us free breakfast, free access to the pool, and free transportation to the airport. However, the breakfast is very disappointing. The breakfast area was dirty, the plates were dirty. They will offer you cereals, bread, eggs, ham, cheese and fruit. It wasn't all that fancy or appetizing. I looked at the pool area and it was underground. There is no light. Small. And even walking down the stairs is scary. The pool area looks haunted. Why didn't we pick it up during transportation to the airport? They could not be trusted, they could be late. And they are expensive. Also the restaurants are expensive. And most of the staff cannot be reached. The stress we experienced in Palde was not worth the money we paid and was not what we wanted as tourists in the country. Even the manager of the other hotel expressed his disappointment with Palde's management and disorganization. Fair play to the manager at Savone who has expressed his disappointment and continued to apologize to us. 92. Comment: Great hotel. The staff is polite and very courteous. I came with my family of 6 - parents, 2 brothers and a wife. Everyone liked everything. I am especially grateful to the manager of the Izzet hotel. The region is also good. All attractions are nearby and ‚Ä¶ 93. Comment: Great hotel for its central location. Even though it is in front of Marmaray and 5 minutes away from Emin√∂n√º or G√ºlhane, what is there to complain about? However, it is a bit noisy as it is literally outside the tram line. ‚Ä¶ 94. Comment: This hotel has a very good location, namely in the old central area of ‚Äã‚ÄãIstanbul, in a very very narrow street with heavy traffic, no parking spaces at all! I found a paid parking lot 50m from the hotel, ‚Ç¨100/5 days. I liked the service... deplorable... Cleaning is done every 3-4 days... there is a lot of mess in the room and when i told him the room has been dirty since i checked in, he sent someone to take care of it... It obviously didn't change anything... same confusion... seed pods on the ground... beer mushrooms... As for breakfast.... wretched!!! The same bad and deplorable food for 5 days of the stay: salad, vegetables, eggplant, boiled eggs, boiled eggs (omelette), olives and yoghurt with cornflakes... Delicious!!!ü§¢ü§Æü§Æü§Æ I DO NOT RECOMMEND IT! CLEANING!!! 95. Comment: The hotel was the worst hotel we have ever visited. The only positive thing was the location. The rooms were not cleaned and there were no clean sheets. We had to ask for towels several times before we got them. The staff came directly to the room after minimal knocking on the door, without giving us time to get dressed. Even on Sundays there was construction work going on and this woke us up early. Other days we woke up to loud screaming children. Breakfast was a disaster - bowls were empty and not refilled despite repeated requests. The situation was made worse when we were told that guests from another hotel were also having breakfast here. The tables in the breakfast room were dirty and unusable. There was also constant loud shouting and arguing among staff. The outdoor areas were also a disappointment. The terrace was reserved for an outside restaurant, so we had to give up our seats often. The bath and spa area was inadequate. The massage was totally overpriced and a scam; we only got 25 minutes for a paid hour. Complaints were ignored. The sauna was never used and the overall hygiene in the spa left much to be desired. There was a musty smell everywhere. The claimed 4 stars of this hotel are completely unjustified. Unfortunately this was a huge disappointment and I would strongly recommend not staying here. 96. Comment: Bad experience non-compliant room, does not look like the photos on the site.|Attic room is not shown on the site‚Ä¶watch your head.|No view because the window does not swing.|What can I say! The mattress is an ultra soft disaster, hello back pain. ‚Ä¶ 97. Comment: The only good thing about the hotel is its location, the rooms do not look like the pictures! The room we got did not have working air conditioning. The door handle didn't close and the towels were stained. The evening receptionist's behaviour was awful, I was charged an extra 90 euros for the breakfast I paid for. They threatened to throw us out of the hotel! The evening receptionist threatened to beat my son if he wasn't at the hotel! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!!!! 98. Comment: Terrible hotel for the price paid. Firstly the spa is not included and is very expensive - the only reason we booked this hotel as there are much nicer places for your money. Breakfast was very poor, everything was...99 even though it was supposed to be hot. Comment: I really did not like the way they work at this hotel. The service is disgusting, on the first day they moved us to a cheap room in the corner where there was absolutely no room. Everything on the site is large and photoshopped. In reality, this is a disappointment. I had to ask the managers to change the room. They refused to give us another room right away but we insisted and they offered another room which was a bit better. Breakfast is poor, almost nothing to eat. Don't expect to eat a filling meal. This kind of service, give me a tip then I will help you. I think asking for tips is a terrible thing to do. You have to help the guests wholeheartedly because that's what you're getting paid for. When guests like your work, tips come from the heart. I am uploading photos of the actual numbers and those on the site so you can decide for yourself. 100. Comment: We hadn't been to this hotel for 2 years. Everything was very clean 2 years ago, so we said we'd go again. after arriving there many things need to be changed in 2 years, for example lack of hygiene (dirty sheets, hair, sheets on the cushions have real stains ..) I had to ask for the sheets to be changed they agreed to change them but the same hairs are so disgusting that we had to put towels over ourselves to be able to sleep and I'm not talking about the bathroom of the toilet, black interior, horror! So after seeing the lack of hygiene that eating there was out of the question, having to pay to eat elsewhere, we could no longer take advantage of the lunch that was included in the price! 101 to avoid. Comment: Although the cleaner mops the room quickly and does not put extra wipes or water in the room, the bathroom is not clean. Two sweet and nice workers. The others do not treat us very well, especially that young girl is very rude, she runs away as soon as she sees us, shouts and makes hard locks on us! He is definitely a psychopath I will never come to this hotel again 102. Comment: Very bad experience in this hotel, cleaning is very disrespectful, we asked them to clean our room 10 times and they only changed the sheets, they did not clean the floors or the toilet, for the swimming pool they asked 500 lira for an hour, very expensive and not included in the hotel price. After paying 500 lira per person, the staff came to take us out after 30 minutes of swimming. The receptionist is very rude and not very hospitable, the area where the hotel is located is a scam area for tourists, I recommend you to stay in taksim not fatih 103. Comment: The location is very good. The rooms are very small and the carpets are dirty, the meters are old and not comfortable. The bathroom is very small and there is no hot water. Breakfast is basic. Restaurant is very expensive and food is tasteless. The spa is a big scam the Turkish bath is faulty but I paid 120 euros and never got my money back. The hotel is run by rude crooks. 104. Comment: They overbooked and moved us to an adjacent building where even the lights and the TV remote were missing. Terrible breakfast at the property next door‚Ä¶ 105. Comment: Rooms are big enough! Affordable price! Some staff are friendly, some are not, the guy on the night shift was not friendly! The rooms need to be cleaner, especially the bathroom! No soundproofing, I was able to tune everything out in the next room! There was always the sound of doors opening and closing, as well as the sound of water boiling! Locations are good and close to metro station, but a bit far from bus station! The overall stay was good! The price was $50 per night for two people! 106. Review: Best places to stay near Hagia Sophia and Blue Mosque. The hotel has a good service including breakfast, swimming pool, Turkish bath and massage but it is not included but still a very good service. |The hotel's cozy restaurant serves delicious food, ‚Ä¶ 107. Review: Our stay at Palde was amazing! The hotel met expectations, the room was good for the price, the cleaning was adequate and a good rest was possible. Then highlighting the reception and restaurant team, extraordinary people, the evenings in the bar were always fun, relaxed and full of joy! :) 108. Comment: Truly one of the worst hotels I have ever been to in my life. The only thing that sets it apart from others is its excellent location, close to markets, but the rooms are cramped and the electricity goes out more than once a day. and it opens again at the same time, thank God it closes and opens again at midnight. And when you turn off the power, the air conditioner turns off and I get up because it's hot and turn it on. I sat there for 4 days, same problem every day. The breakfast is very good. Furniture, towels etc. including the fact of cleanliness is limited to you. If you are someone who just sleeps, walks and goes to the market, you may want to enjoy your stay, I will show you others too. 109. Comment: The location is perfect but the treatment is very, very bad, I do not recommend it in terms of security and cleanliness, I said the rooms are completely different from the pictures. I don't recommend it for families, but the pictures on the website show it's in a bar and you line up at the hotel entrance and at the end of the night you stay awake and drink at the hotel door. Recommendation... and all the Arabs who were with me were complaining about him and asked to cancel their reservations. 110. Comment: One of the worst hotels in Istanbul, scammers, every time you come they ask you to cancel the reservation, you have to give them another price and other rooms. Our room was full, they took us to another hotel, drove us around the neighborhood at three in the morning. I'm afraid the third world breakfast is a scam, the price is too expensive, and the quality is sad, all services are paid... Do not book this hotel, there are better options, I have been to the area several times and it is the worst hotel so far. 111. Comment: They gave me room 501, the door lock was broken, I couldn't close my door, there was an undetectable noise in the hallway, I couldn't sleep all night and when I left in the morning there was still noise. I called at night but they lied saying they would fix it. It was a horrible experience for me, I would never recommend it to anyone. 112. Review: I stayed in 2 rooms 407 and 409 from April 9th ‚Äã‚Äãto 12th. Accommodation in the best location, Hotel breakfast service is good, reception team is really great, helpful and very nice. Especially to Mehmet. Recep. Arsalan. Qader.|Thank you all very much. |This hotel is highly recommended. 113. Comment: The hotel is so far from four stars. They write on booking that they are soundproof, but we hear everything from the rooms next to us, even snoring. There is no lobby where hotel guests can sit, the breakfast is so poor it is a shame for a 4 star hotel. Breakfast is served until 10:30, but if you arrive at 9-9:30 you will only get bred (not fresh), hard-boiled eggs and a few other things. One day we can't find an empty table for breakfast and we wait, the food is not that good, the rooms need to be renovated. Our friends only have shower towels 114. Comment: Bad experience, staff and cleanliness was bad, we had to take 3 rooms to get a good room, food was bad and not hygienic at all, lobby worker had to clean in front of us because of how dirty our last room was. He even asked for a gift even though he wasn't very helpful to us, I don't recommend it at all, the only good thing is the location. 115. Comment: I paid for a 4 star hotel with "ACCESSIBILITY" for wheelchairs, but there is nothing like this (I am disabled with no legs). A 50 cm high stepladder to enter stairs without slipping. Rude staff, especially the person at the reception. Zero cleaning, door trim, tiles, electrical outlets (exposed wires), elevator suspended, shower, water coming out of everywhere but not where it should be. When I noticed the problem at the reception they did nothing for 6 days, taking a shower was a nightmare. There were no plates, cutlery or glasses at breakfast, we had to wait while they washed the used ones. There was also a hotel with a swimming pool, but they were paying 10 euros per entry. We are sorry. I do not recommend it to everyone. They don't even deserve 1 star. Avoiding this hotel The only kind and good person was a lady serving in the breakfast room who went out of her way, poor thing, but the boss "Mehmed-bey" constantly scolded them. 116. Comment: First I made a reservation through booking.com. com and management messaged me via WhatsApp to talk to me. Due to the hotel's proximity to amenities, swimming pool and spa, there are 2 double and 2 triple rooms ‚Ä¶ 117. Comment: There is nothing new to rate this hotel and most staff agree that the treatment received was very poor. There is no cooperation. There is no waste inside the hotel and neither do I. I do not recommend dealing with these people. 118. Comment: The only good thing about this hotel is the location, the rest is a complete disaster. Most of the staff are super. The facilities are a bit old. And super poor breakfast. 119. Comment: The hotel is far from 4 stars. The hotel pictures on the booking portals do not correspond to reality. The promised pool, sauna, Turkish bath and Turkish bath are not included. Although the hammam and Turkish bath were not functional, the cost per person was 10 Euros. There was no refund. Rooms ‚Ä¶ 120. Comment: This hotel is a trap for tourists, dirty rooms, lobby is rented to a restaurant and perfume shop, small rooms, very poor breakfast, you have to pay for the pool, it was a terrible experience, broken shower, never go there, reception ‚Ä¶ 121. Comment: Is it a 4 star hotel? No. Is that a bad hotel too? The location of the hotel is really excellent, within walking distance to public transportation and major tourist attractions. And therefore there is nothing to complain about. The condition of the room was good. It was beautifully finished, little details like the bedside lamp were overlooked, but that's our biggest point. The bathroom had truly reached the end of its life. Broken parts, dirty grout, a toilet seat smaller than the toilet bowl. The shower was nice to use. We found the lack of friendliness and the breakfast itself to be the biggest disappointments of our stay. Breakfast was often over quickly and not replenished. Therefore the choice was very limited. Friendship only came when you bought something from them. Consider a taxi, a tour, or a spa. But we did not use it. Valuation is determined by expectations. 122. Comment: I stayed here for 5 days with my children, housekeeping was cleaning our rooms, changing towels and cleaning the bathrooms every day. The staff in the lobby were very helpful and friendly, they helped me book many activities for my family and were always on time and very interesting. Breakfast was normal but had everything we needed. I will definitely come here on my next trip to Istanbul and recommend it to everyone. 123. Comment:- I had a disappointing experience at Palde Hotel and Spa. Despite its convenient location, the noise from the common lobby and restaurant, which was open until 2am, made my stay unbearable. The hotel reception was unprofessional, the staff (an average sized, bearded man) could be seen chatting and smoking at the restaurant table. When I asked about laundry, I was told to wait until the receptionist finished talking to a colleague. Appalling staff behavior; Management needs to address this issue immediately. Also the overall maintenance of Palde Hotel and Spa was disappointing. The common areas were visibly neglected and the unkempt surroundings reflected negatively on the cleanliness standards of the property. Our dissatisfaction also extended to the breakfast experience, where stacked plates and used handwash bottles were in plain view and did not create an appetising atmosphere. This lack of attention to hygiene and cleanliness contributed significantly to our decision to forego hotel breakfast after just one day. The overall impression was far from the standards one would expect from a reputable hotel. 124. Comment: I don't understand how the star criterion works in Istanbul, because this hotel's value is at most 2. We had no hot water for two days and when you asked for it it seemed almost normal to them. Extremely rude staff, especially the guy behind the reception. The television never worked in the entire living room. They prepare the rooms at 16:30, an hour when any tourist might want to relax after a busy day out, but instead they have to wait (and all they do is make the bed and change the towels). There is a fee for the spa and the elevators are often out of service. The only positive notes are the breakfast and the location. In any case, I definitely do not recommend it! 125. Comment: Miserable service. The room walls are made of cardboard. You can hear your neighbors talking. The breakfast buffet was empty. All that was left was bread and some cheese. When we asked for sausage and eggs we were told they were out of stock. However, we should also note that the hotel has its own restaurant, which opens at noon. Although they have their own restaurant, there is nothing left but a buffet breakfast. The window is broken, the room is too small, the wifi does not work,... When we went to the reception to complain, the nice guy at the reception was sleeping. 126. Comment: Very bad experience in this hotel, one of the worst hotels in Istanbul. It is not clean, the food is rotten, the treatment is bad, the bed is dirty and the internet is very weak. You should stay away from this hotel. 127. Comment: In short this hotel does not care what you think, they only care about money, whatever you say is irrelevant to them, this is very true. The hotel location and rooms are good especially if you choose the corner suite rooms but the staff need more training to deal with guests' problems and the breakfast is very poor and unpleasant area, it is directly connected to the reception and just needs some rearrangement. it's a nice lounge but you have to take into account that it's very crowded and it's not easy to get out so quickly by taxi - the attached video is from my room. 128. Comment: It is a perfect hotel in terms of location, the employees and all the staff in the hotel are helpful and friendly. Frankly, I had a lot of fun at the hotel and it is an experience that I will return to again when I come to Istanbul. 129. Comment: We stayed at this hotel from June 7 to June 11, 2023. I left a negative impression. Not even worthy of 3 stars! It seems the hotel has no owner. The faucet in the bathroom somehow turns on and off. In the shower, the installation of the watering can is located at a height of 1 meter from the floor, it sways, so it is impossible to install the watering can. On the day of departure the hot water was turned off. We requested a transfer to the airport in advance at the reception but the taxi was provided 30 minutes late. 130. Comment: We had a very bad stay! ESCAPE FROM THE HOTEL!!!! Seriously! When I asked to speak to a manager I was told "tomorrow morning" and was put on hold for 3 days and in the end I was not able to speak to the manager because he did not introduce himself to me or even get a response. my request! 0/0 When we arrived the kids wanted to use the swimming pool and were told to pay ‚Ç¨10 per person per day! Shameful for a 4* hotel! This hotel does not offer infrastructure! We chose this place for the swimming pool, among other things, otherwise I would never have chosen it. Cleaning was done very late (15:00) Cleaning Half Completed! The page does not change! No refills: coffee, toilet paper, etc. Breakfast is always the same, no variety! Old furniture and eventually the smell from the pipes! To close the loop, the lady at the front desk was VERY unpleasant! The only positive point is that it is in a good location, but there are plenty of hotels nearby that are worth a detour and which I would choose on my next visit! 131. Comment: I've been at the hotel for 3 days, I honestly don't understand how people can make such unfair comments. The cleanliness and treatment of the hotel is very good, we were blocked. day. Only the location, cleanliness and friendliness ensured that no one would come back, no couch bugs and bad food. On the contrary, they deserve 50 stars. 132. Comment: One of the worst hotels I have ever stayed in. We had to ask for 3 room changes and they still didn't give us the room we paid for. Deluxe double suite is a lie, it doesn't exist or they won't give it. Very rude staff. Don't be fooled by the photos, they don't match the reality at all. Breakfast was a disaster, we had to eat breakfast out every day even though it was included. Cleanliness is average and the finishes in the rooms leave much to be desired. If this is a 4 star hotel, I am Tarzan. The only notable positive aspect is its location, as it is quite central, which makes it difficult to sleep due to the hustle and bustle outside, and since there is zero soundproofing, you can even hear the breathing of guests in adjacent rooms. 133. Comment: Pros: 1 - Great location, easy walking distance to many popular places and restaurants. 2- Nice room and comfortable bed. Cons: 1- The bathroom is old, needs some renovation. The inside of the toilet seat has an unhygienic, non-removable brown color. 2- Breakfast was inedible, some of the food was expired and many were old (not fresh). 3-The employees were not friendly. 4-While we were waiting for the elevator, the power went out for a few minutes. In general, it does not meet the standards of a 4-star hotel. 134. Comment: Magnificent and strategic location, rooms are clean, breakfast is quite diverse, the only drawback is that the soundproofing of the rooms is almost zero, we get the impression that our neighbors share the same room with us 135. Comment: I don't know how this hotel has 4 stars. The staff is rude. Breakfast is so bad that food is almost sold out at 09:30, the hotel has no lobby. The pictures on the booking are not real, they are very old. We did not recommend this hotel. We will never go back 136. Comment: The only plus of this hotel is the location! Otherwise, the rooms are in a terrible condition, dirty furniture and walls, cleanliness - 0 and paper walls - you can hear everything that the neighbors in the adjacent rooms are talking about! It's impossible to eat anything but vegetables for breakfast! We do not recommend this accommodation! 137. Comment: The rooms are clean and comfortable, but the hotel's boss is absolutely rude and walks around with a loud nose. Attempts were made to take cuts at our own hotel restaurant (even though we were guests of the hotel), we were given wrong prices and promises were not kept. 138. Comment: Really good, but please improve your breakfast üôè 139. Comment: Really hotel to avoid. Room very dirty, staff very unpleasant, especially the lady at the reception. Entrance to swimming pool and hamam is 40‚Ç¨. Breakfast is not very diverse and of very poor quality. I have no words to explain how we gave four stars to a hotel that did not deserve two stars. 140. Comment: Hotel is so so!!! It can be heard from across rooms as if your neighbors were sitting next to your bed. Rooms not cleaned, asked twice, zero interest. The spa is a separate attraction. The bathhouse is closed, the sauna is barely warm. Local workers use it to dry their slippers. On the plus side. I don't remember them. We fed him in the morning and he was fine. For this money you can find a much nicer hotel with great rooftop breakfasts and more friendly and helpful staff. 141. Comment: A hotel where I stayed for 7 days and 6 nights between 6/21/2021 and 6/27/2021, which are Corona days. Hotel with an excellent location, 10 minutes walk from Hagia Sophia and on the other side of the Galata Bridge and the Spice Market. There are many popular restaurants and shops in the surrounding area. The staff treated me very well and was helpful. The breakfast was very varied and delicious. Water, tea and Nescafe are provided to the room daily. *** The flaw that caught my attention at the hotel and caused the low score was the lack of insulation in the rooms. Unfortunately, as I lay in my room, I could hear, even though unintentionally, what was going on. even though I was in the same room as the couple next door. 142. Comment: Stay from 22.09.2023 to 6.10.2023 I don't know where to start! Hotel to escape‚Ä¶ run and most importantly don't look back!!! Do not trust the photographs on the site, they definitely do not reflect reality‚Ä¶. A dirty, unhealthy hotel, I will protect you from the smells‚Ä¶ in short, I have nothing to say We had booked a room for which we had to pay in full upon arrival. There was no risk of flying, especially when we arrived after 23:00 at night... a triple room (so it was supposed to have 3 single beds)... We had 2 single beds and an extra bed (I am giving you the night I spent in this bed as a gift) after a long discussion we went to our room the next day. terrible room: dilapidated and unsanitary bathroom, do not contact Mr. Asame or Mr. Sarat ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ in the morning you will be brought back to your old place where you will be treated like bad and overly demanding customers ‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ if you unfortunately booked this hotel, contact yusuf (a nice, helpful person and close to everything to make your stay perfect) You have to pay 10‚Ç¨ per person for access to the swimming pool and it is simply theft!!!! When it comes to breakfast, you should help yourself directly from the bucket where your cutlery is located‚Ä¶. Towels you have to ask them and be careful, the answer depends on their mood‚Ä¶. They collect the leftovers from the tables and put them back on the buffet for everyone to see‚Ä¶ The nice comments about breakfast make me laugh a little‚Ä¶. When you eat your lunch, the bread is almost taken out of your mouth... You don't have time to finish because it's coming at you... Rejection and murat of excellent employees who are concerned about the well-being of their customers. The only positive point is that it has a good location‚Ä¶ sincerely STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL P.S. too bad I can't post videos ü§¨ 143. Comment: This hotel has everything you need for a good hotel in Istanbul, namely a very advantageous location and a comfortable bed. If that's not enough for you, you don't need to move here. Yes, this hotel has definitely seen better days. The rooms are a bit dirty, the carpet and towels are stained. Personally, our room's bathroom door was broken (how? and most importantly why? (sometimes there are so many questions and so few answers) and someone's underwear was lying outside a first-floor roof window. But there is no unhealthy situation or unpleasant odor. There is very good audibility inside: when the alarm clock rings in one room, all rooms wake up: left, right, top, bottom. At the same time, the sounds of the street and the tram passing nearby are almost inaudible. Breakfasts aren't particularly fancy, but overall you won't go hungry. I would especially like to commend the excellent service. The employee at the front desk not only contacted the transfer driver for us, but also escorted us to the car. Well, about the theft that is often written about in reviews here: do not believe it. Not only did they not steal here, the cleaning lady didn't even take the tip that was left to her. Overall, this is a very well located but not very new hotel, a good option for those who want to spend more time in the city than in their rooms. 144. Comment: As far as the East is from the West, I would rather live on the street and sleep on the sidewalk than this wretched hotel. 145. Comment: Noisy, dirty and smells like sewage. The room was smaller than stated. You can hear every word the neighbors say, me and my wife couldn't sleep all night long. The whole room smells of sewage, we complained and gave up the changing room 3 times. Incredibly dirty, I have no idea how this hotel got 4 stars. Only the location is great but everything else is terrible... The owners have probably not invested any money in the hotel for years, it is in complete disrepair... Look at the pictures... 146. Comment: We do not recommend the hotel. There are an incredible number of dark dirt stains on the carpets. The toilet runs all night long. The tram passes right in front of the hotel. French windows can be opened completely and do not require any security measures, railings ‚Ä¶ 147. Comment: The hotel received 3 points. The location is close to attractions, close to Laleli market. The breakfast is good. Fresh salads, desserts - I liked everything. The tram did not intervene. The soundproofing is just awful. The sound of water can be heard from everywhere throughout the night. 2. Of course, it wasn't until 19:00 that day, all the water flows like that. At the reception Noah was very kind and correct, no matter what they asked he explained everything as much as he could. And the kitchen attendant, I don't know what the position is called, he didn't say his name. Polite too. Both are 5‚òÜ. The last day was tarnished by the new big boss at the reception. If he's not mistaken, he looks like Hasan. The red-haired man, who was very rude, shouted that we had to stand on the street after 12:00 and wait for transportation. There were children and babies with us. They were naturally capricious. Luckily, the airport transfer company sent the transport very late; it was Friday, Friday prayers, and they were stuck in traffic jam. The bus arrived at 17.00 instead of 15.00. This caused Hasan to start swearing shamelessly and causing us trouble. He closed the toilet by sticking the word LUGGAGE on the door. Unpleasant man. A lot. He doesn't listen, he doesn't answer questions, he is very rude, he is ill-mannered. And one more important detail: With a single card, either 1. ister 5. You can open any door on the floor. We occupied 5 rooms and tried everything: everything, ALL doors are open. They asked us not to clean the room; the maid, a very kind old lady, gave us more water. And it didn't bother us at all. We stayed for 3 days. Don't ever set foot there again. It's better to pay a little more and stay at a 4‚òÜ hotel. 148. Comment: I will not live there again The location of the hotel is excellent, but the hotel management is bad and the breakfast is even worse 149. Comment: The hygiene of the rooms was terrible. We were assigned 3 different rooms and each room was worse than the last. The carpet was full of stains, the bathroom and toilet were dirty, the towels were not clean, the room was very noisy, you could even hear the neighbors' phones when they were vibrating. As icing on the cake we were given used and dirty cotton swabs (new in plastic). I went to the manager for a refund, he was very rude and unfriendly and I left early with 4 nights left (without a refund). In short, never go there again! 150. Comment: In the photo, the comments on booking may convince you that the room and the hotel are excellent, but the only good thing here is the location :)||||Let's start with the room: quite large rooms, but with very old furniture, dirty carpet, plumbing. ‚Ä¶ 151. Comment: The only positive thing is the location. A few hours before check-in, Booking received a notification about the cancellation of a reservation made a month ago. In correspondence, the hotel said the cancellation was due to a booking error. But later‚Ä¶ 152. Comment: Right in the centre of the tourist area. We only had breakfast, there was variety, we liked everything. The bed was very comfortable, the room was spacious. The view from the window wasn't very good, but overall... 153. Comment: Excellent location. All. This is where the positive aspects end. The hotel positions itself as 4 stars. It only feels like 3... After checking in, it turned out that our toilet was leaking, we told the reception about it. We said there is no master, but wait, they will look at you. After 3 hours we came to the reception, there was already another manager, he came with us, tried to fix it but couldn't. He said the master would come the next day. As a result, during our 3-day stay and complaints, no one repaired the toilet and we were not offered another room. There is absolutely no sound insulation. By the numbers. The rooms are good, they once were... Everything is falling apart now, the shower handles are loose, the carpets are dirty and stained, the furniture is old and crooked. There are cracks, scratches, and dirt everywhere. The shower room really needs at least one shelf to put shampoo and gel jars on. The mattresses of the beds are so soft, you sink in immediately. Breakfast is not bad but the options are limited. Check-out is at 12 o'clock, but at 11 o'clock they knocked on our room and asked, "Are you ready?" We definitely do not recommend this hotel. Look closer 154. Comment: This is a real scam, the photos of the rooms do not correspond to reality. Dirty, old, disgusting breakfast and the staff are unpleasant and snooty. Never go to this hotel, I deceive you not, for your own good, do not stay there and advise no one else to go. Your journey is making your journey miserable. 155. Comment: This review gets one star because of the front desk employee MURAT. He welcomes tourists in black. Doesn't give a receipt. Since POS is not working, payment is requested only in cash in Euros. The accommodation was good. Decent food. The location of the hotel is just right. The person responsible for receiving 1 star is MURAT. Take action! FAKE!!! 156. Comment: The hotel was good, the rooms were clean, the carpets should be cleaned. Background noise from neighboring rooms cannot be ignored. The breakfast buffet is nice but the same every day. The spa area was adequate but the steam room was not open. Overall, the stay was good. 157. Comment: Hi, we spent 4 days at the hotel and I must admit that none of us got any proper sleep, you can literally hear every noise. I can't rate the cleanliness of the rooms that well because there were stains all over the carpet. So I will definitely not visit the hotel again. 158. Comment: Very nice amazing stay Friendly and helpful reception team especially Mehmet. Recep. Kader. & Arsalan Nice location. Good breakfast 159. Comment: One of the dirtiest places I've ever lived. It has neither manners nor thieves. I advise all Arabs to stay away from this filthy house. 160. Comment: Worst hotel ever, don't go there, it's a trap! We came in from a long flight and had booked our room months ago and they told us they had to cancel it because the price was wrong (their fault). Super rude staff and they didn't give us any other options so we had to look for another hotel down the street. Also it looks disgusting, nothing like the pictures, I don't even want to know what the rooms look like! DON'T GO THERE 161. Comment: + A very nice and welcoming building. The staff is ready to meet any request. I was satisfied with the treatment of the entire reception and the hotel manager. Excellent and varied breakfast. Croissants are missing but I've never seen them in the city in general so I assume they're not common in Turkey. Great SPA. The room is quite large and the marble bathroom, the lounge and the structure in general are very beautiful and luxurious. - I had to fix various things that were broken and annoying in the room when we arrived: window that wouldn't open properly, toilet seat that wasn't secured, entrance door that had threads to screw in and smoke deterrent that caused very annoying flashing throughout the night. The manager then dealt directly with management to resolve the issues with our room. Finally, sound insulation from the outside is quite low. Since it faces the street, the sounds of the metro, cars and megaphones can be heard a lot, which seriously affects the overall comfort. It is always recommended to check rooms before assigning them. I would also suggest replacing street side rooms with more soundproof windows. 162. Comment: We had a 4-day holiday with a large group of 15 people between 14-17 October 2021. Not very good. The hotel is located in the centre of the Old Town. The main tourist attractions are 10-15 minutes away on foot. Breakfast is not bad, rooms ‚Ä¶ 163. Comment: Definitely not a 4* hotel... The staff is not the nicest, the room was not very clean and also needs to be renovated! The condition of the carpet in the room was disgusting! As it is right in the centre of touristic chaos the rooms are very noisy, the windows are not soundproof at all. Also the walls are made of paper so you can hear your neighbors as if they were in your room. Breakfast area - a complete mess, dirty tables and area where the food is located. The food selection is very poor and not very tasty‚Ä¶ 164. Comment: TERRIBLE OLD AND DIRTY HOTEL!!!!‚Äô||The hotel COMPLETELY DOES NOT CORRESPOND to the photos and description provided.||Disgusting attitude towards tourists!!!! Don't come here, the rooms are all very old. Shabby, dirty!!! The air conditioner cannot heat the room - the rooms are COLD! At the reception ‚Ä¶ 165. Comment: Good morning, It is a very beautiful building, unfortunately it is not maintained. Very dirty and stained carpet. The rooms have not been cleaned properly for a long time. The carpet has not been vacuumed for 10 days. The toilet was cleaned day and night during our stay (10 days). There is no soundproofing, we hear all the noise from the next room. The only positive point is the friendly staff. 166. Comment: The hotel is generally nice. The staff's behavior is excellent. The location is great and close to the metro. The most important disadvantage is the lack of insulation. You can hear the voices of people next to you in the rooms and the sound of the bathrooms. Room is very small Furniture is almost old and need to be replaced 167. Comment: It would have been a good stay (3-4 * rating), but for a dishonest staff and management refusing to take responsibility. Our group of 8 people booked a stay (for more details see Booking.com). com reviews) and despite the hotel's poor facilities (which are about what you'd expect for the low price), they had a good time. The staff was generally very friendly and welcoming. However, when we wanted to book a tour to Sapanca to see the hills, ride a quad bike, do ziplining and visit the lake, a hotel employee assured us that he could book an all-inclusive tour for a lower price than the tour. the operator we spoke to. We accepted his offer only to find out when we arrived that our quad bike and zip lining had not been paid for as he had assured us and we had to pay extra. Although this is the normal format for Sapanca tours (the ATV and zipline are not normally included in the ticket price), this employee had falsely led us to believe that these activities were included in the payment in order to get our business. This employee mistakenly sold us tickets for a tour that was not as described. When we informed the staff the next day, the employee denied any wrongdoing. Other staff assured us that they understood the situation, acknowledged their colleague‚Äôs mistake and made efforts to contact their managers. Friendly members of staff tried to help us in other ways on their own initiative. But ultimately they had no authority to handle the situation and the hotel manager refused to even talk to us, let alone take any action to resolve the situation. While the majority of hotel staff are very friendly and welcoming, a small minority are dishonest and try to scam guests in any way they can. Unfortunately, the hotel management is apathetic when it comes to dealing with complaints and does not care about the experiences of their guests, and instead of doing justice to their guests, they prefer to sweep such incidents under the rug and pretend they never happened. 168. Comment: Excellent hotel! Very clean rooms, they are constantly cleaning and bringing water! You won't be hungry at breakfast! There is a swimming pool and sauna but we didn't manage to use them! That's right, we touched the water on the perch, it looks warm! The proximity to the tram line did not disadvantage us in any way! The tram line doesn't run at night, but we walked around the city during the day! On the other hand, not having to go far for transportation is another plus! 169. Comment: A nice hotel close to the city center and the historical part of Istanbul. Good value for money. The employees were helpful and friendly. The hotel is a bit old, maybe it needs a renovation to make it cleaner and fresher. Breakfast was nice although not very diverse. The hotel does not have a private parking lot, you will have to find a space on the very complicated streets of Istanbul. 170. Comment: Hotel Palde was booked for us by a tour group for our honeymoon and it was the worst part of our trip. The worst part: -There was no electricity or water in the hotel bathroom on the first night. There was no backup power or regulation for water use. - Hotel staff was rude and did not help with bags from the very beginning even for a generous tip. It seemed to us that perhaps the hotel was understaffed. -The hotel does not provide extra blankets or towels and we were only provided with a single small blanket on a double bed. When we asked for a larger blanket or an extra blanket they claimed they didn't have any left. -There was no ironing service or ironing facilities as the hotel repeatedly claimed. Good: -Good location -Breakfast was good Other things to consider: -The hotel's street is closed at one end and cars and minivans cannot reach the door. You will have to walk a bit with your luggage to reach the hotel. -The hotel does not have a rooftop available for guest use. 171. Comment: Hammam and spa were very very bad. The workers did a quick scrub and foam in 10-15 minutes, but they definitely didn't do it the way they were supposed to. Although we agreed on a 1 hour massage, it was not very relaxing and lasted at most 30-35... 172. Comment: The hotel is clean and has a perfect location in Sirkeci, close to metro, tram and everything. The downside is the reception's poor treatment of guests and lack of respect. The hotel has poor soundproofing, you can hear the conversations of the next room. Especially in rooms facing the street, you can hear the sound of the subway throughout the day. There is no lobby since the entrance of the hotel is a hookah restaurant. The usual breakfast is simple Booking via booking is cheaper than booking directly Room cleaning is excellent Narrow rooms as usual from Sirkeci I repeat the bad behavior of the reception I stayed there for 7 days and I swear I would have left if I had not booked with paid booking 173. Comment: Breakfast is very, very bad. God bless you (one star only to the one who cleans the rooms). If you want to be disturbed, get a room on the Trump side because it is unnaturally loud. But I have an experience that will not be repeated 174. Comment: The hotel advertises itself as 4 stars, but I said 3 stars. The location is very good. Various tourist attractions within walking distance. The room is cleaned once a day. Unfortunately there is no soundproofing at the front door. Everything said in the hallway can be heard in the room. I didn't like the SPA. When you leave the sauna you need to go to the locker room to rinse off in the shower. The lockers in the locker room are not locked. The water in the pool is cool, but the temperature in the sauna and steam bath is not sufficient. There is no water cooler in the pool area where you will relax. In my opinion, 3 stars is very good but not up to 4. Although this was my first time in Turkey and I don't know how it is in other hotels. Compare with Europe. 175. Comment: What's good: location, beds, shower, breakfast ||What's not good: no one wears masks at the reception, why: everything is disinfected!?! Unfortunately many people at the buffet were not wearing masks so we did not have breakfast there. Carpets in the rooms‚Ä¶ 176. Comment: Palde hotel does not even deserve 2 stars due to my 10-night stay experience in September 2022: 1. The online reservation price was $196/night, but booked directly with the hotel for $75/night. 2. The floor mat is disgusting. 3. I could hear the guy snoring from the next room, there is no soundproofing. 4. We woke up two nights in a row between 2am and 4am to the sound of nails/hammers and the use of a drill machine on the wall, we called the Reception twice, they said someone was building a restaurant under the hotel we were staying in, they couldn't do anything. 5. We bought a lot of clothes from Turkey and I kept the tax returns in a bag in my room every day, when I talked to the manager the cleaner threw all the receipts in the trash even though they were kept neatly in the room and asked for a tax return receipt of $40, she said just go to the police station, it's not our problem. 6. We ran out of toothpaste, so I called the front desk and asked them to bring me one, but they said we didn't give any! No toothpaste or brush provided in a 4 star hotel! 7. Breakfast is very simple, the main course is sausage soup with boiled eggs, potatoes and cheese. Long story short, although the location is good, it is not worth staying here. Very rude staff especially when you are not Turkish. Only Ms. Yaren was polite. 177. Comment: When we arrived at the hotel, they gave us two acceptable rooms.||They moved us to the double room on the second day, saying that they had reserved it for someone else and that it did not fit our reservation.
