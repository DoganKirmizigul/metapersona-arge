1. Comment: I can say that it was the worst hotel I have ever been to in my life. The rooms were very small and very dirty, especially the bathroom was very dirty and smelled very bad. The bad smell from the bathroom was coming into the room, we could not enter the room because of the smell of humidity. I can officially say that I have become disillusioned with Istanbul. The employees were not friendly at all. I can say that the location was good, but there are much better hotels nearby that could be preferred. My friend had a wonderful holiday at another hotel, but we couldn't even sleep properly. More importance should be given to hygiene. The lady cleaning the room was a foreigner, she did not know Turkish and we could not communicate, the room cleaning was not finished until the afternoon. 2. Comment: I was very pleased to come to this hotel with my family for a week, it was very nice, the location is close to everywhere, the smiling staff and their attention to detail are very good, the rooms are clean, the breakfast is very good, they are very hygienic in terms of cleaning, Alaaddin Bey, who is constantly coming across us everywhere in the hotel, was very polite and welcoming with a smile, I learned that he is the hotel manager, the guys at the reception communicate and help us 24/7, especially Onur Bey, with his smiling face and conversation, I never got bored during the holiday, I had a good time, thank you to everyone, I will come again and again, this is a hotel that I can recommend to everyone. 3. Comment: Hello, although I stayed at this hotel for one night, this much attention, friendly staff, clean rooms, rich and nice breakfast, everything is there, clean rooms are too much, I think Mr. Alladdin and his team are very clean, friendly, attentive, and super, from now on when I come to Istanbul, I will stay at this hotel, I am satisfied 4. Comment: I really liked the hotel. The location is close to everywhere. Mr. Onur at the reception helped me a lot. I thank him. When I come back, I will definitely choose this place. 5. Comment: I stayed at the hotel for 4 days, it was very nice and clean, the staff was friendly, the breakfast was perfect, I think everything was very good, especially the hotel manager Alaaddin, thank you for his kindness and friendliness üëçüèªüëçüèª 6. Comment: A super hotel. I was very happy. Both the service and the attention and concern of the staff were super. The hotel rooms are spotlessly clean. and I definitely recommend it to everyone with great interest. The hotel is beautiful. I loved it. The staff and their services are perfect. The hotel rooms are very clean. I advise you to go there. 7. Comment: Endless thanks to the Ipek Palas staff for making us feel very lucky to spend our one-week Istanbul holiday in such a beautiful hotel. The holiday was even more beautiful thanks to the staff who love their job. Thanks again for everything. üôè I also have to say that although some guests made things difficult for the staff as if they had bought the hotel, the staff's patience and friendly behavior caught my attention. They do their best to please the customers. 8. Comment: The location is already great. We stayed for a week with our family, the warmth we expected was just as we expected, the staff was very attentive, a home-like atmosphere, our previous trips to Istanbul were torture, it was great to come and rest and go out whenever we wanted, since it was very close to the center and everywhere, it is the only address where we can rest on our next trip and full marksüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª 9. Comment: It was the best hotel I've ever stayed in. The service was great and the surroundings were very clean and reliable. The rooms were very clean. I was very pleased. I definitely recommend it. 10. Comment: The location of the hotel is very good, the rooms are very clean and the staff is friendly and I was very pleased with Mr. Metin Muaz 11. Comment: The only positive thing about the hotel was its location, the daily cleaning of the rooms and the breakfast. The rooms were very small, it would be hard for two people to sleep. My advice to friends who will go there is not to choose the economy rooms, you will regret it, the bathroom is the same as the 12th floor. Comment: A great hotel, the rooms are very clean and hygienic, I stayed with my family for 2 weeks, the service of the staff is great, thank you for everything. 13. Comment: The best hotel I chose for a holiday with my friends, the friendly staff, the breakfast service, everything is perfect, we were very pleased, we recommend it to everyone, and we thank Mr. Aladdin, who took care of us in every way. Comment: Located in the heart of Sirkeci, within walking distance to all historical places, this hotel is a place where you can stay with your family with peace of mind. The staff is very helpful and helpful in every way. The rooms are clean and the breakfast is rich. We will come again. We would like to thank Mr. Alaaddin in particular. 15. Comment: The gentleman at the reception is impertinent, disrespectful and unfortunately, despite being older, he does not know how to talk to people. It's a huge disgrace that someone like this is working here. Even though I received an e-mail stating that I made a reservation, her curt response saying that the reservation was not in the system and that it was none of my business was a joke. There may not have been a reservation, but a human being would offer the customer a solution to the problem and would not try to swear at them. Although I have stayed at this hotel frequently before, after this last incident I definitely do not recommend staying here. Istanbul hotels are full. Sleep on the streets if necessary, but do not make money for such impudent people. 16. Comment: I recommend it to those who want to see silence, peace, respect and tolerance in the crowd of Istanbul. I was amazed by the service of the staff, the location and the cleanliness of the hotel. Thanks to Ipek Palas and its staff 17. Comment: We would like to express our gratitude to our historical hotel, our hospitable front desk manager, hotel managers and everyone who contributed. We were very pleased and we recommend it to you with great pleasure. Best regards, 18. Comment: The view from the room and the access to everywhere are very good. The service they provide is also very nice. When I come to Istanbul again, I will go to this hotel comfortably. 19. Comment: Rooms are a bit small. The service you receive and the location of the hotel definitely make you forget this situation. 20. Comment: We were very happy with our stay at the hotel. The staff is great, especially Mr. Memet at the reception, he is a very respectful employee. The location is already great, close to everywhere, we loved it. We stayed for 6 nights and the breakfast was also nice and had many varieties. The hotel was also clean. The only problem we had was the wifi connection, we learned the reason for that and hopefully it will be resolved next time. We will definitely come again. 21. Comment: The staff was very helpful and attentive (reception, cleaning staff, waiters etc.). The location is close to Sirkeci train station and most places you want to go. The rooms were cleaned every day and the breakfast room was nice and had a wide variety. 22. Comment: We came to Istanbul for the first time, I liked the ƒ∞pek Palas Hotel very much. The breakfast is excellent, the service staff is super, Ms. Ezgi fulfills everyone's wishes perfectly. Our rooms are cleaned every day. Many thanks to the cleaning staff AyYƒ±ldƒ±z and Ms. Suna. A professional team. Many thanks to the restaurant manager Mr. Alƒ±m, he cooked us a delicious feast. At the reception, he made us happy with his jokes and kind words and the night cruise he guided us on. Many thanks to Mr. Timur and his assistant Mr. Bilal. I will recommend ƒ∞pek Palas Hotel to my friends 23. Comment: The ladies who were cleaning were doing a perfect job of cleaning and tidying up the surroundings, thank you, good job. Both the friends at the reception and the other staff were all friendly and helpful, thank you. There was a WhatsApp problem, but that problem was not a big deal for us, because I could not even use half of the internet package I had purchased. The prices, food and staff of the Sultan Restaurant were very good, thank you. 24. Comment: First of all, the location of the hotel is very good, within walking distance to everywhere, the rooms are very spacious and beautiful, thank you very much to Mehmet Bey who took care of us, I will come again on the 25th. Comment: Overall it exceeded my expectations. The size of the room and the breakfast were very good, the bathroom was large but the shower cabin was so small that it was impossible to move in it. 26. Comment: My wife and I had a great holiday. The staff was very attentive, the breakfast was excellent and within walking distance of historical sites. We would like to thank Mr. Aladdin for his interest and concern. 27. Comment: The location is very convenient, centrally located, and transportation is very easy. The buffet breakfast was very tasty and sufficient. The staff is friendly and attentive, the rooms are very stylish and clean. Operations manager Mr. Aleattin and front office manager Mr. Mehmet were very friendly and attentive. Thank you for your interest. ‚ò∫Ô∏è 28. Comment: I booked this hotel for a week. Mr. Metin and Mr. Harun took very good care of me during the reservation. The hotel was very clean and all the staff were very sweet and friendly. I definitely recommend you to go. 29. Comment: Located in a great location to truly feel Istanbul, the hotel is truly fascinating with its historical structure and view. Perfect. Endless thanks to all the staff who did their best to make every moment unique while feeling the history. They offer a wonderful, caring and friendly environment. We loved it so much that we will choose it again on our next visit. 30. Comment: The hotel was very nice, I stay at this hotel every time I come, its location is close to everywhere, the staff is very friendly and good, especially Mr. Aleaddin and Mr. Mehmet are very attentive, many thanks to Mr. Adil at breakfast for his attention, the friend at the reservation, Mr. Metin, is very modest, it is definitely a hotel I will come and stay at again. 31. Comment: Those who write comments must have never seen a hotel. The cleaning is zero. The bathroom and toilet are neglected and not suitable for use. They are falling apart. They turn on the heaters after 8pm. The lobby is freezing. The room is freezing. The staff is unfriendly and the breakfast is the same. I came two days in a row. They don't even put water in the fridge. I stayed for 4 nights. What a disgrace. I wanted to leave but couldn't get my money back. I had to stay because we paid in advance. And there was a construction site. Disgrace. Disgrace. 32. Comment: The location of the hotel is in a very good place. The breakfast was nice. The workers were good and helpful. In the hotel pictures the rooms were big and nice but in reality they were very small. When we asked for another room, they gave us a nicer room, but when we opened the window, we couldn't see outside. 33. Comment: We stayed at the hotel for 1 week to visit Istanbul. The location was perfect. The rooms were very clean but a bit small and there was a bad smell coming from the sinks. The staff was very attentive. Breakfast was also limited in variety but good for a 3 star hotel. By the way, make sure to go up to the Terrace Restaurant because the view is magnificent. We especially thank Mr. Ertuƒürul and Mr. Adil for their interest. 34. Comment: We stayed at the hotel for 1 week and we were very pleased, first of all we would like to thank the manager Mehmet bey, he helped us with everything. The hotel was very clean. Breakfast was open buffet and everything you could want was available. We looked at the comments before coming. I do not understand some of the negative comments. Please review the room price balance. Bilal Bey was also very helpful and cooperative. 35. Comment: The hotel is very clean and nice. It is close to everywhere. We are very pleased with the staff, they are all very friendly and respectful. Thanks to everyone and Mr. Mehmet 36. Comment: At the reception, Mr. Firat and Mr. Timur welcomed us very cordially when we first met, they fulfilled our requests, the rooms were very clean, the breakfasts were in a very good condition, and everything was within walking distance, so we were very pleased. 37. Comment: The hotel is very central, everything is within walking distance. The rooms are very spacious and clean. There is no need to describe the breakfast, there are many varieties. Mr. Mehmet at the front office was very helpful and helped with everything. Thank you for everything. See you soon. 38. Comment: Caring and friendly staff, quality breakfast and most importantly the most beautiful location in Istanbul. I definitely recommend it. Special thanks to Alaaddin Bey. 39. Comment: A hotel that doesn't even deserve its current 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è, we were in this hotel with my wife and daughter and the shower etc. We had no problems, everything was fine, but for some reasons we had to leave this hotel quickly while we were making preparations. We had forgotten a gold necklace that belonged to my wife and was very valuable to her. Then we decided to call the reception of this hotel and warn them in which room we had forgotten such an object, but the reception told us that they would call us in 10 minutes, we understood and waited more than 1. hours and still no call, we then decided to call them back, but the same scenario repeated more than 10 times, only to receive a different call this time, they clearly told us that there was no collar in the room. It took us hanging around for more than 2 days in a row to finally tell us nothing was happening. Incompetent staff, be very careful. 40. Comment: One of the most beautiful hotels I have stayed in Istanbul. I would like to thank the smiling staff, especially the receptionists Timur Bey and Fƒ±rat Bey. It is the cleanest and most hygienic hotel in Istanbul. I would like to thank all the staff and the entire management. See you soon... 41. Comment: It is in a great location, When you first arrive, they welcome you very nicely, After giving information about the hotel, you can go to the restaurant on the terrace floor and enjoy your holiday by watching the beautiful view of Istanbul with tea and coffee, You can even make a reservation for the evening and have a nice dinner with a beautiful view. The rooms are very nice, air-conditioned, a place where you can go to the market and visit Sultanahmet, Sirkeci, Emin√∂n√º whenever you want, the prices are very reasonable compared to hotels in Sultanahmet, if you want to come to Istanbul on your holiday, do not miss this opportunity, do not forget to stay in this beautiful hotel, I say have a good holiday to everyone in advance, I would also like to thank the staff and managers for their interest. 42. Comment: Hello.... Thank you very much to our brother Cemal... It helped us a lot... Thank you, may it last long... And let me also say that we were pleased with the hotel... Everything was fine, hello 43. Comment: In general, all the staff were very good. It was in a very central location, close to everywhere. Mr. Mehmet took great care of us. In general, everything was good. 44. Comment: I stayed for 4 nights, everything was great. Friendly staff welcoming you at the airport. And to Mr. Mehmet. Thank you very much, 10 out of 5 stars. Silk palace 45. Comment: First of all, the hotel is very clean and in a central location. Everywhere is within walking distance, I wonder why those who wrote bad reviews wrote them. But first of all, Mr. Mehmet, the Front Office Manager, helped us a lot. We thank you very much from here. See you next year, 46. Comment: The hotel is very nice and clean, the staff are all friendly and helpful, the hotel location is great, everything is within walking distance. Thanks to everyone and Mr. Mehmet üôèüèº 47. Comment: Location is perfect very clean and staff is friendly 48. Comment: The location of the business is good. He said the system was faulty and kept us waiting for more than an hour. Anyway, he gave us two rooms. I wish we hadn't stayed. The rooms are terrible, one facing the ventilation system, the other tiny rooms, the towels are stinky and smelly, don't be fooled by the lobby. Also, when entering, the gentleman who was looking after the reception on 29.07.2022 was very nervous, as if he was doing his best to mistreat people there, his style and behaviour were very problematic. 49. Comment: We stayed at your hotel for 1 week, we are very pleased, especially your employee Cemal helped us a lot, thank you very much. 50. Comment: It was very bad, they gave us 1 room for 2 people, we could hardly move, it was very small, the bed covers were always covered in blood stains, even the toilet door would not close. They called a taxi and it turned out to be a pirate taxi, so what you need to do is... 51. Comment: The hotel is very good and clean, everything was very nice, see you next year HeereüôÇ 52. Comment: The location of the hotel is very good, the breakfast is quite rich, the employees are friendly and helpful in every way, thank you very much for everything, see you again 53. Comment: This is my second visit and I am very pleased again :) The hotel rooms are a bit old but there is no fault in the cleaning and the breakfast is great. It has a beautiful view from its terrace and I recommend you not to return without drinking Murat Abi's tea! 54. Comment: The hotel is in a very central location, the breakfast is very good, the rooms are clean, good job to everyone, see you next year. 55. Comment: The rooms are bad for the price charged, the cleaning is not very good, there were stains on the sheets. the items are old. Breakfast is terrible for the price charged, you only have two or three rotten olives and two types of cheese for breakfast. It is not a hotel that deserves three stars, think twice before making a reservation 56. Comment: A very comfortable, clean and high quality hotel. ESPECIALLY the staff are very respectful and modest. I would like to thank each and every one of them. 57. Comment: We stayed with my family for 1 week. The hotel room was very clean and nice. Especially Mr. Onur was very attentive. Thank you very much for your interest. 58. Comment: I have been staying at the same hotel for years. My biggest preference is that the staff is friendly and the hotel is very safe and clean. I thank them very much. 59. Comment: I stay every week, I liked the hotel more thanks to Mr. Timur, he is someone who will add value to every business with his smiling face and sincerity, thank you Mr. Timur 60. Comment: We stayed at this hotel twice and we really felt at home. Mehmet Bey was very helpful to us. See you next year üëã 61. Comment: This is the second time we have visited this hotel. We were very pleased the first time, but we were shocked the last time we went, it was very different from the first time we went. The staff was very nice and friendly. But this time it failed in terms of cleanliness. The towels and sinks were not clean at all. We had to call the reception every day to ask for new towels. It is a great place in terms of location, it has a very central location. 62. Comment: The hotel is very nice, I stay there every time I come, the staff is very good, especially Mr. Timur, he is a kind, knowledgeable and polite person, I thank him very much 63. Comment: The reason I gave this hotel 5 stars is because Mr. Muaz took care of all our shortcomings and provided us with a perfect holiday. I would like to thank him very much. 64. Comment: It is better to sleep in a tent outside, 11 m2 room for 2 people, even the toilet door does not close. The sheets were covered in blood stains, and we asked for a taxi from the hotel, saying it was safe, but even that one turned out to be a scammer and didn't even turn on the taximeter. It was very bad, never again, fix the water elevator too. 65. Comment: If there was 0 stars, I would give it 0. It was not a hotel that fit the pictures at all, quite the opposite. Everywhere is dirty, never cleaned, no garbage taken away. I think they should pay more attention to cleaning the rooms rather than paying attention to Covid-19 in the cafeteria. It's not even a room for one person, it's so narrow and dirty, it's the worst and most disgusting hotel I've ever been to in my life. Nothing worked in the room. In short, if I can't find a hotel anywhere in the world, I won't go to that hotel again. The street is cleaner than the hotel. 66. Comment: The hotel is very clean, the staff Mehmet is very friendly, I will come again next year. 67. Comment: We stayed at this hotel for 8 days. The staff is very good and friendly. Unfortunately, the rooms were not nice at all, we ended up in the worst part of the hotel when we first arrived. We were able to change rooms on the second day, but the rooms were not as they appeared on the internet. ‚Ä¶ 68. Comment: I did not like this hotel at all, where we stayed upon the recommendation of a friend. The room is so small that two people cannot move around in the room side by side, one is waiting for the other. The toilet and bathroom are very old and when you want to take a shower there is a small disaster and every ‚Ä¶ 69. Comment: I have been coming for 2 years, It is a great hotel, super staff, also Mr. Timur took great care of us, Everything was great, thank you very much, Greetings 70. Comment: ƒ∞pek Palas hotel is a really nice and very clean place. All of the employees are very nice and attentive. First of all, I would like to thank all of them very much. I recommend you to go too. 71. Comment: We stayed at ƒ∞pek Palas for 2 weeks, everything was great. I would like to thank the front office Mr. Mehmet for his help in every matter. The rooms are really very clean. Breakfast everything is fresh and very tasty. The location is walking distance to everywhere, no need for a taxi. see you again. 72. Comment: Reliable, family friendly and friendly staff üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü 73. Comment: If the guy at the reception who was not happy with us staying out in the middle of the night is reading this, I would like to thank him from here. The room was small but it didn't matter. The hotel was clean. Breakfast was an open buffet and a gentleman on duty constantly warned us to use gloves. Pandemic is also among the places I would prefer. 74. Comment: Date: 30.10.2018 We are about to check out from the hotel. We stayed for 1 week, I definitely do not recommend it to any of my citizens, not even to tourists. An extremely awful and dirty hotel. The beds in the rooms are old, the shower cabin in the bathroom is dirty and leaks water. When entering and exiting a room, the door handles remain in our hands. The rooms smell of damp, there are no channels other than 3 or 4 on the TV. The blow dryer is broken. We asked for a quilt because it was cold at night, but they don't give quilts before November. We said the shower cabin in the bathroom was leaking water, they said they would take care of it, the holiday is over but they are still going to take care of it. So no matter what you say, they find an answer to everything you say. We did not receive any good attention from anyone other than Mr. Erol who worked at the reception. We also thank Erol abi from here. Those who read and evaluate this article will be pleased, those who do not evaluate it will regret it. Clear and concise. Saigilar 75. Comment: It is a disgraceful hotel, primarily because of the attitude and behavior of the staff. As a tradesman, I come to Istanbul every month and have stayed in many places, but I would not come here again even if I stayed on the street. I was shocked when I saw the room after paying for 2 days... 76. Comment: We had a nice holiday with my family. walking distance to historical places, the staff is friendly, we especially thank Mr. Alaatin, see you again 77. Comment: First of all, I would like to thank Mr. Alaattin very much. It is a very nice hotel in a central location. The breakfast is legendary and the staff is amazing. See you next year. 78. Comment: I would especially like to thank Mr. Mehmet G√ºnaydƒ±n for his help and interest. The hotel is located right in the centre, at 79. Comment: I stayed with my family at the hotel Ipekpalasta, the location is really perfect, the staff is friendly, the breakfast was good, thank you, see you again... 80. Comment: The hotel was very bad, the rooms were humid, the air conditioning was not working. When we asked for a new room they didn't care and said they were all the same. When we went for breakfast the plates were completely oily and disgusting.. I've been to a lot of hotels and I've never seen a hotel as disgusting as Silk. Even this 1 star is too much, unfortunately 81. Comment: The hotel is very nice, the breakfast is very delicious, the rooms are very clean, thank you to everyone, see you next year 82. Comment: A complete disgrace, the staff is a thief, they accuse you by saying we didn't take the items they took from the room, stay in the tent, stay in your vehicle, but still don't stay here 83. Comment: The hotel is very nice, we were very pleased, we would like to express our gratitude to Mr. Cemal. 84. Comment: We were very pleased with Timur Bey who welcomed us. You can be sure that we will make our next choice at this hotel again. Comment: It's not a hotel but a hostel, hygiene is zero, as if they just dust and leave. The rooms are so narrow that two people cannot pass side by side. The staff is indifferent, there is no greeting or morning. In terms of transportation, the location is very good. The breakfast is nice. Other than that, we were not satisfied at all. 86. Comment: We were very pleased, it is a family hotel close to all historical places, the staff is friendly, we would like to thank Mr. Alead for his interest and attention. Comment: Friends who will stay in the historical peninsula, there is no car park, there is Ispark next to Sirkeci Marmaray station, 300 meters walking distance 88. Comment: In one word, it is terrible, do not be fooled by the person you talk to on the phone or the pictures, I am writing this as someone who was personally disappointed. take it seriously. Even the family rooms are so small you can't open your suitcases, the children's bed is just a convertible armchair. The cleaning is terrible, the staff is rude, the air conditioning does not work properly. 89. Comment: The hotel is very nice, the breakfast is excellent, I recommend it to everyone, a hotel to stay with the family, thank you to the staff 90. Comment: We were very pleased with the hotel. Everything is within walking distance. Thank you Mr. Mehmet, see you next year 91. Comment: We stayed with my family and we were very satisfied. The location is very good, the cleanliness and the breakfast are very nice. 92. Comment: The hotel is very clean, everywhere is within walking distance. Thanks to Mr. Mehmet for his help. 93. Comment: Very clean and reliable, I recommend 94. Comment: Thank you very much for your interest. It was a very thoughtful gesture, especially from Mr. Muaz, to be so cheerful. Thank you. 95. Comment: We had a wonderful holiday with my family. We would like to thank Mr. Aleaddin for his attention and concern. See you again next year 96. Comment: Yes, the hotel I stayed at on the first night of my 2-day Istanbul tour.. Generally a nice hotel, centrally located and very close to historical and touristic places.. Recommendedüëç .. But I didn't like the attitude of the gentleman at the reception.. ‚Ä¶ 97. Comment: Since it is a hotel that I visit regularly, I would like to thank all the staff of the hotel and the hotel itself for their hygienic maintenance and the attention they show to the customers. 98. Comment: We were very pleased with the hotel. Very close to everywhere. Mehmet Bey from Reception was very helpful in every matter. A hotel we can come back to again. The rooms were clean. We were pleased with our breakfast. 99. Comment: The current rooms are very dirty. This hotel does not deserve the name Palace. The mood of a person is spoiled 100. Comment: I went to the hotel upon recommendation but I will never go back. They did not let my guests into my room for 3-5 hours. Among them was a mentally disabled guest. A person named Yavuz Bey did not allow me to go. Even though we said he was uncomfortable. Too bad I have nothing else to say. never again. 101. Comment: First of all I want to say this, if it was possible I would give the hotel 0 stars instead of one, why is the water cut off, the air conditioner is working very poorly, one of the staff is behaving aggressively, the towels are not clean, more accurately it is stained, the toilet brush is broken, clean the room, we did not hang the hanger, the cleaning lady just barges in, I don't want to say much more, it's disgraceful..... First of all I would like to say that I am giving the hotel 1 star, if possible I would even give it 0, because there was no water for a whole day, the air conditioning is very weak, one of the employees is very aggressive, the towels are not clean, or rather have stains, the toilet brush is broken, clean the room, we did not hang up the hook, the cleaning lady just goes in, so I really can't say anything more, a disgrace..... 102. Comment: The location is very nice, the staff is very helpful, especially thanks to Mr. Mehmet, he showed us everywhere we wanted to go. Ertugrul Bey was also very helpful and good 103. Comment: A clean and cute hotel. It is an advantage to be in a central location. But it would be better if the rooms were not so narrow. The breakfast is nice, good quality and varied. And there is also the problem of parking. We now have to use the train station parking lot. The employees are friendly. 104. Comment: There are clean, very nice rooms and a good welcome, the staff is very cheerful and very friendly, they take care of you personally, thank you very much to everyone :)) 105 is one of the few hotels in Istanbul where you can come and relax like at home. Comment: The hotel is 125 years old with its historical and authentic structure. As a historical destination center, a business that has adopted transportation and customer satisfaction as its principles. It has adopted quality as its vision and mission with its friendly staff. You will feel right at home. 106. Comment: There are 2 TVs in the spacious and comfortable rooms, one of which overlooks your bed, but the negative thing was that I was limited to 3-5 channels, NTV. I would say the breakfasts are average. 107. Comment: Our favorite hotel. I came 4 times and we were always satisfied. The personal is super and always smiling. And it is very close to both the bazaar and the most beautiful places in Istanbul (Topkapi Palace, Sultanahmet, Hagia Sophia and Basilica Cistern)... üëçüèªüëçüèª ‚Ä¶ 108. Comment: Clean and well-maintained, the meticulousness of the managers is reflected in the hotel. May God grant us good and fruitful earnings. 109. Comment: The hotel is very nice, the breakfast was very nice, I recommend it, thank you for everything. I would also like to thank Ms. Ezgi, see you again. 110. Comment: Disgrace. The air conditioning in the room does not work and the heater does not work. We changed the room, the TV is facing upwards, you can only see the screen when standing, the inside is very neglected, it is not at all like it seems from the outside, there are cupboards in the rooms but there is not even water, it is a shame, go and get water for 30 cents and put it in 111. Comment: I went to pick up my tourist couple from the hotel to take their photos. A small hotel, the staff are friendly and attentive. Thank you also to 112 for your help. Comment: I have been staying at ƒ∞pek Palasta since 2020, we are very pleased, I would like to thank the staff for their interest and kindness, especially 113. Comment: It is one of the rare hotels that I really do not regret going to, especially Ms. Ezgi was very helpful to us, I recommend it as a hotel to come back toüòå ‚Ä¶ 114. Comment: Mr. Aladdin is a very good person, we were very pleased, and the workers were very tolerant and nice, I was very pleased. 115. Comment: The hotel rooms I stayed in for a meeting in Istanbul were old, outdated, not clean and not fit to stay in... A substandard hotel for people with no expectations...For those without high expectations... 116. Comment: I came upon recommendation, the staff is helpful, the rooms are nice, not very comfortable but it is a good place to go compared to the Sirkeci area, the price is normal, there are mosques and restaurants nearby, there are beautiful historical streets, in short, it is a suitable place to stay at 117. Comment: If you are ever in Istanbul, I think your only address is 118, where you can stay in peace and security, where the location is very central, the cleanliness is excellent, the food is great, the staff and management are very attentive and friendly, the rooms are very spacious and the historical atmosphere and aesthetics are intact. Comment: It is the oldest hotel in Istanbul after the Pera Palace. A good hotel for its class. The staff is friendly. The location is great. Very close to transportation means (Tram, Marmaray, ferry). 119. Comment: It is a great place, I would definitely recommend it if you are just looking to stay somewhere without any transportation problems. 120. Comment: Helpful staff, everything was great, I would also like to thank our brother Cemal for his help 121. Comment: Thank you very much Mr. Muaz, you are very interested and helped us a lot.

Comment: The hotel was of good quality, as were its staff. Especially Ms. Ezgi, she was very interested in us, we thank her very much. Comment: I have been going to a hotel for years and none of the TVs in the rooms show any TVs. They have not found a solution to this for years. Yes, you are right. Unfortunately, they say this. In addition, there is a water sound coming from the radiators in the rooms until the morning. It keeps you awake until the morning. There is the same sound in all rooms. 125. Comment: The restaurant was nice and the food was delicious. Thank you to your chef's hands.. 126. Comment: The hotel is nice. Ms. Ezgi is very caring, thank you very much for everything.

Comment: Very nice hotel with delicious food, very suitable for families 129. Comment: I forgot my charger at the hotel, even though I called and told them, when I went to the hotel they said there was no charger. The guy at the reception spoke so quietly that I thought he couldn't talk. May God forgive me, it can't be like this. The hotel is nice but because of this problem, don't forget that it's 1 star, the hotel is 130. Comment: It is a place where families can stay in a central location with good cleaning and according to its class. 131. Comment: Everything was great, but if they were a little more careful about hygiene, I recommend this hotel to everyone. Good luck to you 132. Comment: It is a small and very cute hotel, the staff and the room were very good, but the noise of the young people outside at night was very loud in room 133.

Comment: Everything is great 223. Comment: This hotel is in a perfect location for exploring Istanbul on foot. I see many negative reviews about the room size. My room was number 107, double bed, sofa, excellent air conditioning and fridge with complimentary water provided on arrival‚Ä¶ 224. Comment: The hotel is in a super central location. The staff's welcome was very warm, the room we stayed in was simple and practical... very good bed. Towels are changed daily! The breakfast buffet is quite rich! A very good start to the morning. From here, all tourist attractions can be easily reached on foot or by public transport. We were very pleased... A very clear suggestion. 225. Review: Best area to stay in Istanbul: Most major attractions are just a few minutes' walk away, public transport options are great and there are plenty of restaurants nearby. Excellent customer service - staff were always helpful, smiley and friendly! The rooms are quite small (who spends time in the room on holiday anyway‚Ä¶) but clean. The breakfast was delicious, we looked forward to it every morning! We really enjoyed our stay :) 226. Comment: Strategic location, very small room, shower without hook and perfect breakfast for those who eat salty food in the morning, french fries, soup, cheese etc.... Unfortunately, it's definitely not for us. It wouldn't hurt to pay a little more attention to desserts. High level of staff professionalism!! But not 4 stars. 227. Comment: The room is ok but the bathroom is small, with a sink too small for children and a built in bidet. In short this hotel leaves nothing to be desired. Service is mediocre, the good thing is the great location close to everything. 228. Comment: I had an economy room and was traveling with my mother for 5 nights. The room was small but served its purpose as there was only room for sleeping/resting etc. We came for breakfast so didn't bother but I saw some of the rooms were a good size when they were being cleaned so maybe it was just the economy rooms that were too small. The first two nights were on a weekend, our room window faced the main road so there was a lot of traffic noise late into the night but weeknights were quiet. Apart from being clean and comfortable. Breakfast was a traditional Turkish breakfast. The location was fantastic, walking distance to the Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia Spice, Grand Bazaar and the Waterfront and we walked to all of them. There's also plenty of hustle and bustle and restaurants nearby. If you are staying here you should have dinner at the restaurant next door called Hoca Pa≈üa fish & meat house, it is a small family business, we went twice and the quality of the food and service was amazing ‚ù§Ô∏è 229. Comment: ƒ∞pek Palas Hotel Istanbul|Located in the heart of old Istanbul, just a few minutes' walk from most of the major tourist attractions, the historical hotel truly lives up to its name. Decorated as befitting an Ottoman palace and ‚Ä¶ 230. Comment: Conveniently located, close to Emin√∂n√º market and ferry services for boat trips and connections to the south bank of the river.|Also a 10-minute walk from the Hagia Sophia mosque complex. (Note: Uphill‚Ä¶ 231. Comment: The hotel itself is good. The location is also good. The staff is good. But with numbers..... I downgraded for this. 1. It's very small, even if you can't live there just spend the night. 2. Air conditioners are old and noisy. 3. 5. There are boilers on the upper floor, noise can be heard at night. 4. Windows or mosque - it is ‚Äúpleasant‚Äù to hear prayers in the early morning. Or Windows on the road - drivers honking non-stop. Wi-Fi works fast but intermittently. 232. Review: I have been to Istanbul several times and this was the most amazing experience, I cannot compliment the hotel enough, Omar and Muaz were exceptional. I will recommend this hotel to all my friends who come to visit this beautiful city. The location, food and hospitality were all fantastic, this is the ideal hotel if you are visiting Istanbul. 233. Comment: The hotel has an unbeatable location, 10 minutes from the Spice Bazaar and 10 minutes from Topkapi/Sultanahmet Mosque/Hagia Sophia. The rest fits the bill but is far from 4 stars. Clean but outdated rooms, superior double rooms here are the size of a normal double or even smaller (135cm bed). They need a refurbishment, once you enter the hall it is a complete disappointment to get to the rooms. The staff are very friendly and the included breakfast buffet is okay, perhaps lacking in variety from one day to the next but has a bit of everything. If you want something to sleep in and have everything to hand, this is great value for money, but without the fanfare. 234. Comment: This is my 6th visit to Istanbul. It was my arrival, I've never had such a small room before, the room was so small, there wasn't even room to move. The bed was too small for a couple and the bathroom was so small the toilet seat was broken. The only good thing is that the rooms are clean‚Ä¶ 235. Comment: The hotel is in a central location. You can reach everywhere on foot. The breakfast was good. Also the employees were very friendly. Everything here is reasonable for the price you pay. 236. Comment: We experienced a dangerous accident during our stay. A fire broke out in the hotel. It was midnight on August 26th. We spent some time on the street. I later went back to the room but couldn't sleep because of the smell and stress. We later learned that this was a common occurrence in this area as the buildings were mostly quite old. I also do not recommend getting a Turkish bath service at the hotel because it is not worth the price. It is better to book a hotel with a SPA area. 237. Comment: Very nice and clean hotel and the staff is top quality! Absolutely everything is great... I will definitely be back! 238. Comment: The hotel was well located and perfectly clean. In my case the rooms were very small. As for breakfast, it was the worst, very repetitive and not replenished, they were more interested in removing the cutlery rather than replenishing it, so you were left without being able to try other items. 239. Comment: We really enjoyed our stay at ƒ∞pek Palas, the metro was within walking distance.|For food, I recommend you to try ≈ûehzade caƒü kebab, which is just outside the hotel and is number 8 in the food world. The hotel is clean and nice. Single ‚Ä¶ 240. Comment: It was a nice hotel and the people were very helpful. I had a nice stay and the rooms were tidy. Not big but nice. The location was perfect and it was easy to get to different places from the hotel. Highly recommended. I would go to this hotel again. 241. Comment: Respectful staff. Good rooms. In a clean, air-conditioned place. The location of the hotel is easy to access. It is also possible to bargain on the price. Payment method On the day of Eid, they brought us sahur meal instead of breakfast. I recommend it to everyone who comes to Istanbul. Respectful staff. Good rooms. Clean the bathrooms. Good breakfast in a clean, air-conditioned place. The hotel's location is in the heart of the tourist area. Easy access. It is surrounded by many different restaurants. It is also possible to negotiate on price and payment method. On the day of the eve, they brought us sahur meal instead of breakfast. 242. Comment: It was good, service was average, especially Metin Muaz and √ñmer Bey, they are really good. The location is amazing, there is a tram and even a train right next to it, you can even walk to Emin√∂n√º to catch the bus. Without forgetting the breakfast which is always varied. ‚ô•Ô∏èüíì 243. Comment: A very nice hotel in the center, right next to everything you need and you can walk to anywhere you want from food to clothing stores, places to visit, I spent my holiday in this hotel and was really pleased with the services, the staff, the room. The breakfast was very very tasty and good. The staff were very friendly, kind and helpful and the employee (matien mauz) was always asking if people wanted to have a drink while sitting on the terrace, I thought that was very nice and very friendly from him So I would recommend and continue 244. Comment: Warm welcome, friendly staff. The hotel is clean and very nice, and the location is good (mosques, grand bazaar, cisterns, etc.). We had the honeymoon suite, it was a large and beautiful room. We had a good stay. 245. Comment: I have been coming to this hotel for 7 years. The hotel is located directly in Sirkeci. This makes it particularly central; the train is within easy reach. Sultanahmet, Hagia Sophia, Emin√∂n√º, Galat Tower, all major touristic places are within walking distance. The hotel staff is really nice, committed, friendly and helpful. The economy rooms are small but enough for such a city trip where you will only sleep in the evenings, the other rooms are much larger. It is quite normal to have loud noises in a metropolis, but since the hotel is also central, you can hear many things from outside that are not disturbing. The breakfast is quite sufficient and delicious, and also hygienic! Many thanks to Ms. Ezgi. My family and I would like to thank Mr. Mehmet and Mr. Bilal very much. We always feel good. We are like a family now. 246. Review: I was a little worried about staying here considering the other reviews, but my experience was very positive overall! Be aware this is one of the oldest hotels in Sultanhamet, not modern but it was squeaky clean. The breakfast buffet was good but the hotel was very affordable so it was average. The location was great, 10 minutes from Hagia Sophia. It is a very hilly city and this hotel is located on one of these hills. All the employees were very nice, especially Onur üôå 247. Comment: Super satisfied. The service is top notch, the venue is top notch, the staff (especially Mehmet and Bilal) are top notch. 2 minutes to Sirkeci train station, 2 minutes to Marmaray, 5-6 minutes to Emin√∂n√º port. Economy rooms can be small, so it is better to book a standard room. We felt very comfortable :) 248. Comment: A very nice, cute hotel located close to all tourist attractions, rooms are a bit small and cleaned every day. The service was very good and I would especially like to thank the gentleman at the reception who helped me retrieve an item I left at the hotel, he very efficiently arranged a vehicle for me to bring it to the airport, thank you very much.
