1. Comment: This is the first time at Concorde De Luxe Resort in Antalya, but not the last! We arrived on October 1st, the weather is still beautiful, 28-30 degrees, sunny all day. The staff welcomed us, everyone we met was very friendly and welcoming … 2. Comment: We came from another resort because we thought we would try somewhere else while we were in Antalya. I was drawn to the Concorde because of the high ratings and positive reviews, but to be honest, it's not the best resort out there as expected, 5 … 3. Comment: My wife and I stayed at this hotel in early October and we were very pleased. First of all, we liked the hotel's botanical garden-like trails and spacious grounds. It's great to have small tasting stops along the way and to have different alternatives throughout the day so you never have to worry about food. The sea is sandy and gravelly, slightly wavy. The sunbeds are uneven, which is nice, but almost impossible to find where you want them, I think the guests were putting towels on them the night before. The main restaurant seemed to us small and inadequate. But it wasn't a big deal because of the taste and variety of food we ate during the day. The pool was very large and adequate, but it seemed a little ridiculous to book only the relaxation pool. We said we were cold at night, and they sent an electric heater during the day, which I really liked. The staff and service were average, but of course this is a relative situation that varies depending on the service you've received at hotels you've visited in the past. Animations were good and sufficient. All in all, we had a nice and enjoyable vacation. 4. Comment: I traveled with my wife and two-year-old son. Overall, we had a great stay at the resort, but I think there are a few things that made our stay better than other resorts we've stayed at. ||First, … 5. Yorum: We can highly recommend the hotel, it is clean, the staff is very polite and helpful. The food is amazing and tastes great. The rooms are very spacious and well equipped. The complex is very large, clean and has many opportunities to drink, eat and relax... 6. Comment: We stayed 3 nights as a honeymoon couple from October 8-11. First of all, I would like to focus on the building structure. I think it will adapt to a city with pure white facades that give the impression of an Arab country compared to the gold-leafed hotels in the neighborhood. Although the building's form may seem symbolic, due to its shape, many of its rooms have almost a sea view. I was very successful in finding a solution to the layout and layout of the hotel. Most areas can be accessed from the G floor. The main events take place near the pool - in the garden. Entry and exit to these areas is provided through a single door. It could have been a much better and more attractive door. It looks like a door that leads to the backyard for smoking. Gardening works are very successful. It gives the impression of being on vacation in a tropical country. There is a variety of FAST-food in the pool. Day and night activities are well thought out. Cleaning the room is good. The staff is friendly. We went to Da Vinci a la carte. We ate burrata-pizza-calamari. It was delicious. The wine was very good, but the wines on the buffet seemed not so good. The open buffet was very comprehensive and we had a mixed massage for 100 euros. The price may seem a bit high for Turkish guests. It was good, but I can't say we were impressed. We were satisfied with our honeymoon and think it was the right choice. 7. Comment: From the reception, we had a fun and comfortable vacation. - It was wonderful to be able to use all areas of the hotel, especially the lush garden with a stroller. Congratulations to the staff who take care of the garden. - When we got to the hotel, a bed and a bath were ready for our 3-month-old baby. There is also a diaper changing facility in each restroom of the hotel. - I sincerely congratulate the kitchen team. It was the best hotel kitchen I have ever seen. We met Italian, Indian, Turkish nights. It takes a very large team to produce such diverse, neat and incredibly tasty dishes. In addition, if you do not want to eat in the main restaurant, a la carte restaurants are also open during the day, and each is successful in its own way. The assortment of buffet tables is also wide. - The beer garden is spectacular. You can enjoy a variety of beers, both fresh and bottled. All of these are served by opening bottles in each bar of the hotel. -Every evening there was an entertainment/show or party, none of which were indifferent. -You can always have access to the clean beach towels you want. - Although the hotel is crowded, there is a well managed physical space, you don't feel crowded or chaotic. A few recommendations: -Unfortunately, there is no place to use towels and sunbeds. We also witnessed a fight to find a solution to this problem. - Cocktails - sure, they can be made in a hurry, but - they can be prepared with a little more care. Thank you Concord family. 8. Comment: First visit to the hotel. The place is big but very clean. The service was great, the restaurant staff made such an effort with us, and the entertainment team was fantastic, engaging with both adults and children (special mention to Ata). The food was great, don't expect a full English fry up for breakfast but if you're up for a taste of the local cuisine you'll be in for a treat. We didn't go to other restaurants because the main buffet always changes the themes. The daytime entertainment was a laugh and the evening entertainment was also good. The rooms were clean and comfortable, but I didn't give 5 stars because I thought they would be a little bigger than they were. The location was good, beautiful beach area and beach. Outside the hotel you will find small shops within walking distance, but with all the hotels on offer we don't need to go out! Would go again. 9. Comment: Staying at this hotel was amazing! Everything and everyone was perfect. The rooms were beautiful, the hotel was amazing, the food was delicious and the staff was amazing! They really cared and did everything to make our stay comfortable and relaxing. We truly felt and were treated like royalty. The best holiday ever! Can't wait to see this place again ❤️❤️ 10. Comment: Big disappointment. The price of the hotel is very expensive. The food selection is terrible and looks like a college cafeteria. We felt hungry for the first time in Turkey. We have stayed in many great hotels but this was a real disappointment. There is always a wait for service in the restaurant, and the staff is great. They say they have 24/7 security, but things keep disappearing and no one bothers to check the cameras. We had to go to reception three times in one day! To make matters worse, our room was not properly cleaned; there were no fresh towels or toilet paper. On the positive side, it is possible to note the beautifully landscaped area with mandarin and pomegranate trees and date palms. The massage was also very professional, a girl from Bali (Tina). We would say that this hotel is not worth the money. 11. Comment: I had a great stay at this hotel! The service was absolutely wonderful, I would like to give a special thank you to Mr. Hasan and Mrs. Bashak from the reception. Both were very helpful, friendly and made my stay exceptionally enjoyable. Thanks for the great service! … 12. Comment: Great hotel resort, everything was clean and tidy!! The hospitality is excellent, you are always served no matter what you ask for! The food is very good, you have many choices! At the resort, you can retreat outside in peace or simply relax among the people. The beach is very nice and clean, even the sunbeds! Concorde let us stay in the cabin for free for a day. Cabanna also had the ability to call if you needed anything. But we were often spoiled with drinks and food so it was a real luxury holiday!! The entertainment was so much fun! We went to a Michael Jackson show and it was really good and Michael Jackson was real!! We loved dancing too!! All the hotel staff were very sweet and attentive and willing to make you feel at home. Have a delicious holiday and delicious food! I miss those words... I want to go back to Turkey, to Lara, to Concord Hotel! Visit the waterfall, the old town and all the shopping malls in Alanya! I hear there's a lot to see in Roman Alania! In fact, I give this hotel 6 stars, not 5 stars!! 13. Comment: My family and I had the most amazing 12 day vacation at this hotel and we couldn't be happier with our experience! From the moment we arrived we were greeted with warm faces and excellent service. Every staff member went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and cared for. The room was clean, spacious and had great views. Housekeeping was thorough and thorough, ensuring our room was always in perfect condition. The hotel amenities were top notch, we loved the pool and the variety of activities for adults and children. The dining experience was exceptional! The variety and quality of the food exceeded our expectations, and the restaurant/bar staff were always welcoming, especially to our son, who made every meal/drink a wonderful experience. What really made our stay memorable was the excellent service. The staff consistently attended to our needs and made sure every aspect of our stay was perfect. We left with great memories and can't wait to return. Thank you to all the team for making our holiday unforgettable! 14. Comment: I liked the hotel. A beautiful green area, clean, a lot of entertainment, the beach is very big and clean. The sea is beautiful) near the airport. The rooms are large and clean. The staff are pleasant and always solve problems quickly. On working with guests... 15. Comment: Stayed here with my parents and absolutely loved it, the shows were amazing every night and there were always games throughout the day to keep you entertained. The pools are big and not too crowded which is great. The parties are next level, so much decoration and great music. Honestly, the only negative thing about this hotel is the kids show between 9 and 9:30, that pants ahah! Really local for shops along the way. A wide variety of food during the day and at night, even for me who likes to pick my food. The beach is beautiful. The staff are amazing, especially the animation team, who made my stay even better as I was the only young adult with my family, they always encouraged me to have fun and take part in activities that were amazing for someone as indecisive as me. The wait service is amazing, and sometimes there are language barriers, but eventually the bar staff start to remember your orders, or at least it did for us. There are skaters in the pool who take your orders and deliver them to you, which is awesome! This is a beautiful hotel with very professional and friendly staff, I really recommend. Much love to Concorde Hotel and staff <3 16. Comment: The best vacation ever! We spent a week at this beautiful all inclusive resort. The meal was excellent! Each evening had a different menu and different animation! We enjoyed the pool and the beach was amazing! 10/10! We will definitely be back! 17. Comment: We stayed at the hotel for 2 weeks with our family and had the most amazing stay. From the hotel, guest relations, kids club (moppets), food and entertainment, it was truly first class from start to finish. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the staff. An all-inclusive ultra with branded drinks, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, as well as a large list of well-known cocktails was an added bonus. Our daughter enjoyed the children's entertainment from morning to evening. There is a special area for children and they are very well looked after. Activities are age appropriate and every child feels included. The daytime and evening entertainment was great for the adults too, so not the usual late night shows. These specially designed and organized shows were very entertaining. Overall a great hotel stay and would highly recommend for adults and families. 18. Comment: The hotel is very nice, I can say that it was our most enjoyable summer vacation. My wife and I came in October. The animation team is very funny. Evening entertainment and pool entertainment are excellent. I would also like to thank Mehmet Ali, Ata, Mehmet, Arda, and Duygu from the Fun maker team. They made us very happy. The variety of food and the number of places to eat are very large. There are 5-6 paid a la carte options for dinner. Most of them offer free a la carte lunch and breakfast. For lunch there are two open buffet restaurants, a small corner of baked potatoes in a separate place, a corner of grilled bread in a separate place, corners where you can eat fried chicken, quality and variety of toasts. It's great to have them in separate areas and to walk around the hotel or come across places to eat and drink all the time. On the beach there are sisters who make pancakes and chiberek, they are very delicious. Our only complaint about the food is that the main restaurant has different concepts every day: Asian - Italian - Mexican - Turkish, etc. Some days it was difficult to find food that suited our taste. Other than that it was great. Every employee is very friendly and sincerely tries to help you. I would also like to mention the renovation of the hotel, we were really impressed. The gardeners were also very friendly, and the people present gave information about the trees. The rooms are very clean and we had no problems in terms of hygiene. Although the hotel is full, there is no overcrowding or chaos anywhere. The main pool is very nice and there is also a relaxation pool for over 16s. But we didn't really need it because the pool was so big and not crowded. It might be better because there are more kids during the school holidays. In general, the holiday was very fun. Many thanks to all hotel staff. 19. Comment: Unforgettable experience: relaxation, entertainment and comfort Monday's Turkish show was exceptional, as was the entertainment team that created a great atmosphere. The service in the main restaurant as well as other restaurants was impeccable with very fast service. The women who prepared the food were also very nice. There were various events and nightly shows which provided variety. The hotel is large, which allows you to enjoy moments of peace even when there are many people. The hammam with free entry was a real plus; You can shower in the evening instead of roommates. The beautiful beach allows you to swim in complete peace without any worries. 🙂 20. Comment: We stayed here for over 4 days and had a great experience with our 2 year old. He especially enjoyed spending time at the kids club - the staff were very attentive and interactive with him and he loved playing with all the toys they had to offer, as well as arts and crafts, painting and even face painting! The kids club play area was also a huge hit with my daughter as well as the kiddie pool which was very busy and a huge hit with her. He also loved evening entertainment, especially children's discos and children's shows. Overall, we were very pleased with the variety of food and the cleanliness of the rooms. I will definitely recommend it to other families. 21. Comment: First, we stayed at the Concorde Hotel for 5 days. When we first stayed at a hotel...||First, we stayed at the Concorde Hotel for 5 days. When I first booked the hotel, I had some doubts, but after arriving, most of them left... 22. Comment: Overall a very good hotel. We entered the hotel with enthusiasm. I can say that it has a good kitchen with good food and drinks. Waiters on roller skates attend to our every request throughout the day. There are many types of alcohol and they are all in sealed bottles. This is an important aspect that we look for in a hotel. The entertainment team is doing well. There is a complete team spirit. There are many sporting events during the day. Every day we are called from the heart. Music in the pool made our holiday even more beautiful. We were very pleased with all the staff. The pool was more than enough for us. Pool water and beach were clean. An honest hotel worth the money. We want to come again. We wanted our holiday to never end. 23. Comment: Very good 5-star hotel. Excellent service, very clean and attractive atmosphere. The food is great, the pool is great. There is an additional reservoir on the beach. Very nice staff at the hotel. There will be great shows every night! I can only recommend this hotel 24. Comment: I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Concorde De Luxe Resort and it was truly a wonderful experience from start to finish. From the moment we arrived the staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and attend to our every need with genuine warmth and professionalism. The culinary offerings were amazing. Whether it was breakfast, lunch or dinner, every meal was a delight. The morning spread was varied and fresh, from delicious pastries to omelets made to order. Lunch and dinner were equally impressive, with options to suit different tastes, each dish carefully prepared and flavorful. For families, the children's entertainment was special. During our vacation, there were many activities and programs that kept our children engaged and happy. The hotel has a good understanding of how to cater to guests of all ages, making it an ideal destination for families. Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a family vacation. The combination of exceptional service, exquisite food and thoughtful amenities make it a preferred choice. We can't wait to return! 25. Comment: The amenities of the hotel were second to none. The spa offers an oasis of relaxation with experienced massage therapists and rejuvenating treatments. The pool area was an inviting retreat complete with comfortable sun loungers and attentive poolside service. The culinary experience is equally impressive, with the restaurant offering exquisite dishes made with fresh, local ingredients. They have a lot of activities day and night and they invite you to it and what really sets this super cool Concorde Hotel apart is the exceptional staff. Their genuine hospitality and willingness to go the extra mile made our stay truly unforgettable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a luxurious and unforgettable experience. 26. Comment: Overall, all the staff were very attentive and friendly from the moment we walked in. The service at the food and beverage bars was very good. The animation and entertainment team took very good care of us throughout our holiday💯 I would also like to thank the waiters and the friendly Baristas, everything we wanted was brought to our sunbeds by the pool. The room cleaning was a great success and I would like to thank my friends who never left our small closet empty.👍🏽💯💯💯 27. Comment: The hotel is very good. The rooms are very clean and modern. The pool and beach are also clean and well maintained. The staff is very attentive and your requests are taken into account. When faced with a problem, it is solved immediately. Only curiosity, concern and a smiling face deserve 5 stars. Alcohol used in bars is also of high quality. The food at the open buffet is varied and delicious. The ala carte was also very good. Our favorite place was the escape bar, which we made a habit of visiting after dinner. I would also like to thank my friends who took care of us. Also thank you for sending me a cake for my wife's birthday and compensating me for not having a beer of my choice on the menu. But there is also a point. The hotel has a few minor flaws that I think are relatively easy to fix. Although the facilities are very good, I think they are understaffed. Your colleagues seem very busy, but they can't make it. The waiters at the open buffet forgot to bring us drinks more than once. I also believe that the cocktail training of the bartender friends is weak. While some friends give their due, other bartenders are below average. They obviously don't know how to make some cocktails and serve a lot of cocktails. When I started counting the cocktail problems, 1-2 out of 10 cocktails turned out to be correct. I don't think anyone has any bad intentions, but because they appreciate the alcohol content of cocktails, most of the time the alcohol content is a little less than it should be. I understand that a very talented and experienced bartender makes decisions by eye, but the cocktail business is a matter of proportion. However, your friends will pay attention when you warn them. These are issues we are very selective about, but they don't affect everyone the way they affect us. We've taken our problems to customer relations, but drinking education isn't a one- or two-message issue. So I don't think it's worth deducting points here in the hotel's price range. We've had a good week and I've mentioned things I've told my friends and would recommend, good or bad. 28. Comment: This all inclusive hotel exceeded our expectations! The food was delicious with a variety of options for each dish. The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, always going the extra mile. Great amenities and activities made our stay unforgettable. Highly recommended! 29. Comment: Best Hotel Experience As a large family, we always chose Bodrum hotels because they were close. This year we wanted to try the Concorde based on the reviews and we already consider staying here every summer. Staff: From skaters to housekeepers to customer relations, all staff are extremely attentive and committed to your satisfaction and comfort. During our stay, customer service inquired every day if there were any problems and resolved small issues promptly. Dining: Each evening has a different world cuisine theme (Indian night, Italian night, Asian night, etc.). In addition to delicious dishes, it also impresses with vegetarian, diet and children's buffets. This is where the difference between 5 star hotels comes into play; Some 5-star hotels may have a maximum of 2 types of meat and fish, but here the options are very wide. Events and animation: You can leave your children in the kids' club and spend your vacation in peace, as well as participate in professional activities for children and adults during the day and evening. (Foam party, DJ performance, Mrs. Concord, ceramics, theater, etc.) Thank you to Mrs. Tulay and Mrs. Aileen, customer relations staff, and Merdan, skater, for their interest throughout the holiday. Best hotel experience As a large family, we would stay at Bodrum hotels because of their proximity. Based on the reviews, we decided to try the Concord this time, and we now plan to stay there every summer. The Staff: From the skaters to housekeeping to customer relations, the entire staff is extremely attentive and dedicated to your satisfaction and comfort. During our stay, the customer service team checked in with us every day to make sure everything was going well and they were quick to resolve any minor issues. Food: Each evening has a different world cuisine theme (Indian night, Italian night, Asian night, etc.) and in addition to delicious dishes, the vegetarian, diet and children's buffets are impressive. This is where the difference between 5-star hotels becomes clear; Some 5-star hotels may offer only a few options for meat and fish, but here the choice is wide. Activities and entertainment: You can leave your kids in peace at the kids' club and enjoy your vacation, as there are professional activities throughout the day and in the evening for children and adults. (Foam parties, DJ performances, Mrs. Concord, pottery making, theater, etc.) 30. Yorum: After a long search, Concorde was our choice. I'm glad it happened. I'm currently staying at the hotel and I'm so excited I couldn't wait to leave a review. From the moment we checked in, friendly staff took care of us in every area. Room hygiene is very good. The room has everything you need. Our room was right next to the spare room and we mentioned that it was a bit noisy in the morning and then they contacted us immediately and said that they had spare rooms and could switch them if we liked. Although our concept was a land view room, they changed us to a sea view room. We have one last day left, and we're sad to leave, but this is a destination we can choose with our eyes closed for our next holidays.🤍 31. Yorum: I liked the variety of food options and choices every day. A lot of activities to do, a lot of competitions are organized. The service of the team and staff working here is amazing, they are very friendly, helpful and very attentive. The cleaning ladies are very attentive to the needs of their customers, I felt really pampered, a great experience 32. Comment: Great hotel, food was great, housekeeping and entertainment were great, pool games were great and I enjoyed everything. The beach is gorgeous and there are plenty of places to sit and relax. A huge selection of food and drink, including vegan, vegetarian and non-alcoholic, all of which are on my side. The staff are very friendly and efficient; nothing is too difficult. Highly recommended. Date of stay: September 33, 2024. Comment: First of all, cleanliness was the most important detail for us and we were very pleased with it. Its landscape is magnificent and gives the feeling of being in a forest. We liked the beach, its decoration and the variety of sunbeds. If you like a private beach, come to this section specifically. I found the restaurant to be small and less food options compared to other hotels we stayed at, but the restaurant was clean and the food was delicious. There were different varieties every day. The swimming pool and animations were very good, as we are a family with children, we were satisfied with the problem and overall we were satisfied. Hotel 34, which we will return to. Comment: Overall, a very good family hotel. The small club was a good place for the little one. They have a separate pool for babies/kids. The food is decent with lots of choices on the buffet. Each evening has a different theme. The staff is very friendly and caring. If you have any concerns, you can talk to the guests who will solve everything. Honestly, this is a 4 star hotel with 5 star features and offers. Some facilities are dated and not exactly "luxury". 35. Comment: We lived as a family with 3 children. The drinks are of high quality, the food is varied and tasty, the room and common areas are very clean, the room is at a sufficient level, the animation is active, etc. Best of all, the hotel has a team to help with any issue (hotel related or not). The day we entered the hotel, our daughter collapsed and required hospital intervention. We thank the hotel staff, especially Mr. Gian Solei, Mr. Kamil Chinar, Ms. Ezgi from Guest Relations and Ms. Kubra from the lobby bar for their friendliness and interest. Without your interest, our daughter would have had an accident and we would have left immediately on the first day of our holiday. We appreciate you being with us every step of the way, in the hospital and then at the hotel. Thank you, it was a holiday we will remember with joy. At every hotel you get enough to eat, swim and have fun, but the quality of the staff is not easy to find everywhere. What made our holiday and this hotel unforgettable was your excellent attention and friendliness as a team. Although we like to visit different hotels every year, we hold this one apart and want to visit again and again as often as possible. We send love and hope to see you next year. 36. Comment: A great all-inclusive hotel with everything you'd expect.|If you're into activities and entertainment, you can also easily find peace and relaxation around the very large grounds and gardens.|I can only fault it. … 37. Comment: Everything was great. The rooms are very clean. The toilets are great. The food is of high quality and caters for every taste. There is a variety of food on the territory of the hotel. pool. Everything on the beach is very beautiful Animations are very interesting. For small guests... 38. Yorum: The food was very good and varied. The best thing about the hotel is the food. On the contrary, the food in the main restaurant could have had more variety. Repetitive feeding can be every day. The beach was blue flagged and very clean. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Night animations were of high quality and interesting. Live music was good. It was nice to have the A la Carte restaurant options for lunch. The taste of the food here was also at a high level. The Beer House, where you can taste more than 30 types of beer, was very good. The landscaping of the hotel was beautiful, but the trees were so tall that it took a while to find out where it was. Direction signs should be clearer and their number should be increased. The cleanliness of the room was generally not good. When we first walked in, we saw threads and hair in the toilet bowl. No toiletries, no conditioner and no body lotion. We stayed for 4 nights and the rest of the days were unfinished. Bartenders were not of the same standard. Ms. Nurzhan at the Pool Bar and Mr. Mustafa at the Sunset Bar were very caring and nice. We thank them again. However, some bartenders focused on making simple cocktails and serving guests. Therefore, we think it is important that the provided service meets the same standard. The water park was not up to standard and there was no attendant in the small drinks area. Cleaning the jacuzzi pool was not enough. Since there are trees near the pool, it is normal for leaves to fall into the water, but this pool was not cleaned during the day. Therefore, the number of dead bees and leaves in the relaxation pool and jacuzzi gradually increases during the day. 39. Comment: We stayed for 4 nights between September 16-20 and couldn't get enough. There are so many flavors to taste, so many corners to explore. Every day was full. All the staff, the rooms, the environment, the food, everything was very good. - The staff is very attentive, they come to you during meals and on the beach and ask if you have any requests. They are always smiling and I really stopped to think how everyone can be so kind and they are never bored. Everyone is doing their job properly. - The food in the main restaurant is delicious and varied. There is food for everyone. There are also vegetarian and vegan sections. There are many types of cheese, meat, salad and dessert. The quality of the cheeses was not bad, everything was very tasty. The leaf liver was my favorite, it was very tasty. - Sweet sections were also successful. I've tried waffles, chee burek, pancakes, hamburgers, and pizza. My favorite was the stone oven thin crust pizza. Especially if you get hold of it when it's new, you can't get enough of it. - There are also a la carte restaurants. Free shuttle services are available during the day. One night we opted for a steakhouse. The food was hot and the meat was excellent. The meat was very good in terms of portion and taste. If you like meat, I definitely recommend trying it. We opted for the T-Bone and Dallas Steak and were satisfied. - The beer garden is a very interesting place and has many types of beer. Non-alcoholic beer was also available. Cocktails are good. Alcohol/non-alcoholic options available. - The sea sand gets deeper only when it goes a little further. Fortunately, every day was uneventful. That's why we couldn't understand its clarity, swimming in peace is a pleasure. There are plenty of sunbeds on the beach, as well as sunbeds and covered areas like tents. Above all, one of the most beautiful features of the hotel is that it has (16+) rooms for relaxation. There are recreation areas in the pool and on the beach, where children are not allowed. The pool is large and there is also a jacuzzi in the relaxation area. I also liked that the pool had wooden floors. -The sauna has a glass screen that looks out, so you can waste time looking at the sky while lying down. - There are darts, backgammon, table tennis, bowling, tennis, basketball and football fields. There are also great walking/jogging paths, green and peaceful everywhere. - Local residents and foreigners were mixed. There were many families with children. We especially enjoyed it after the schools opened, but there were also many families with children under school age. A cart appears everywhere, and every meal is accompanied by a child's cry. A special dining room can be allocated for families with children. Round tables are suitable for them, but not everyone likes them, they sit scattered. There are also playgrounds for children. - Animation programs in the evenings were very interesting. Every day was a different and interesting activity. It was a happy holiday because we were glad to have come, glad to have chosen this place. Thanks for everything. I can recommend it with peace of mind. There are videos and photos about the hotel, information can be obtained from anywhere. Haven't come across any bad comments or negative situations, thanks to everyone's efforts. Have a nice holiday to those who chose ;) 40. Comment: The entertainment at the Concorde Hotel is generally very pleasant and varied. The hotel offers its guests a variety of service options; It is full of events such as evening shows, live music and themed parties. In addition, the activities held in the pool are also very interesting. There are also special activities for children, which is a big plus for families. Overall, it offers a good vacation experience for both adults and children. The quality and variety of entertainment ensures that guests have a great time. Ermekshi Mehmet is specially designed for this job and will not leave people bored for 5 minutes. 41. Comment: We had a great vacation with our friends at the Concorde Hotel. Everything was perfect from the first moment we entered the hotel. The pools are big, the sea is clean and there are always activities. The animation team was very energetic, the evening shows were very interesting. We didn't have any problems with the food either, it was varied and everything was delicious. It was a pleasure to spend the night in the hotel bar. In general, this holiday was full of fun and laughter. In short, this is a place to come and have fun with friends! I definitely recommend it. 42. Comment: The hotel has a great concept. The range of food and drinks is wide and of good quality. The daytime service of a la carte restaurants creates a different quality. The food served is of high quality and very tasty. The 24-hour service at the pool bar is very satisfactory. I would like to thank the bartenders Okan and Emir for their service to us. The hotel's events and nightly shows are also great. The concepts of day and night shows are very good. I would like to thank the animation team behind these shows. Especially to Arda, Mali and Ata. I think the hotel rooms need a bit of tweaking. The range of confectionery products is insufficient and of poor quality. Far from the hotel concept. I would like to point out that the sound system of the hotel is bad and needs to be changed. In general, we were satisfied with the hotel. I hope to see you again. 43. Yorum: My family and I had a very enjoyable vacation at the Concord Hotel. The location of the hotel is excellent, close to the city center and by the sea. The rooms are big and very clean, everything is carefully prepared. The staff were very polite and helpful. The food was very tasty and varied. We had a wonderful vacation with my family. This is definitely a hotel we would consider returning to! 44. Comment: We visited Antalya for the second time. Since our first choice hotel was booked, we chose the Concorde. You will not regret choosing this hotel. Everything was fine from check in to check out. All facilities, lobby, restaurants, … 45. Comment: We spent our entire 3-day vacation here. This is in my top five favorite hotels. The staff are very hard working, friendly and never rude. The hotel area is large, so even though he was a man, it didn't affect me at all. The area of ​​the hotel is so big, they gave us a small map, they were very kind. Ms. Diana and Ms. Fatma, who work at Daphne Restaurant, were very sweet. I hereby express my love and gratitude. The activities at the pool in the afternoon were very pleasant and helpful, especially Ms. Özlem who was very compassionate and knowledgeable. The design of the Vista bar is amazing, the paintings were interesting in the hotel, but the ones here caught my attention and the service there was also very good. The presentations are very good. For the first time, I wanted to be a regular person in a hotel. Everything is designed for the comfort of guests, cleanliness and order everywhere. For those who don't want to partake in the evening's animated entertainment, the Escape Bar has live music in the open air and a gentleman's voice is soothing. A facility that offers guests a variety and variety of quality. The drinks are from the hottest brands and the bartenders are experts. I'm not an expert in these things, but as a vacationer I liked it and would like to come back ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 46. Comment: Third day of our trip so far and enjoying our stay. The food was great, the facilities were great, and the moppet kids club was a big hit with our 5 and a half year old. The animation team are very friendly and nothing seems too much trouble for all the staff we met. The communication from the hosts was also helpful, as was the reception with a room request shortly after our arrival. Looking forward to the rest of the break! 47. Comment: We stayed at the Concorde for 10 nights. After several visits to Turkey, we compared many things. Overall we were very impressed. We had a junior suite for 3 people. Yes, modern with bathrooms and two bedrooms and a great mini bar. We loved all the top brands of drinks and all real soft drinks, no cheap stuff or taps, the cocktails we loved were great too. The food was good, the buffet was well mixed each night, with good quality meats and choices. The beach is perfect and there are always beds which is great as we hate getting up early to get a bed. There were always good activities at the pool. The staff is also exceptional and the best we have encountered in Turkey. Everyone is very polite, helpful and genuine. With a special shout out to Grandpa, he went out of his way the entire trip and paid tribute to the hotel. We never go back to hotels, but if we did, we would definitely come back. Thank you Concorde for making our holiday truly special. 48. Comment: I researched your hotels for a long time and as a result of research we decided to come and stay. This was the best decision and venue we have ever made for a holiday in our lives. Especially the people at Kids club and the Kids club team are so nice and caring, it's obvious that they love their job. A group came to help us when we were thinking about what kind of holiday to celebrate with our child. We have an active child, and although we hesitated to leave him alone on the first day, he never called once from morning to night unless he needed food. We would like to express our gratitude to all the employees of the Children's Club. It's good that they exist. :) 49. Comment: Great all in one place We stayed at the Concorde Luxury Resort for 5 nights and it was amazing. From the morning fitness clubs, the swimming pool and all its amazing sports, we enjoyed every detail here.. amazing food served in various restaurants of all the resorts.. the welcome team around the resort, they were really friendly and welcoming.. Not forgetting the team of fun creators, they were just the cherry on top. Loved this place and we will definitely be back Comment 50. Comment: The room is spacious and beautifully decorated, with an amazing view of the city skyline. The bed was incredibly comfortable ensuring a restful night's sleep. I appreciated the thoughtful amenities like complimentary bottled water and a well-stocked mini bar. One of the highlights of my stay was the breakfast buffet. It offered a great variety of options, including fresh fruit, pastries, and a made-to-order omelet station. The dining room was bright and inviting, making for a great start to the day. The hotel's location was perfect — within walking distance of the main attractions, making it easy to explore the area. I also took advantage of the spa, which provided a relaxing atmosphere and top-notch treatments. 51. Comment: The best part of the hotel was that all the staff were very friendly, caring and happy. There was no employee who did not say hello while passing by. Everyone at the poolside, including the bar staff, waiters and animation team, will ask how you are and if you have any queries without you having to order. Enough activity. Although the hotel has a high capacity, you will not feel crowded in any area. Throughout the day there are activities for families with children and adults. It's great that the water park is independent from the main pool. Food and drinks were very tasty and of high quality. The beach is sandy, the sea is mixed with sand and pebbles, deepens and clears after 3-4 steps. The guests are as qualified as the hotel and staff. We stayed as a couple, this is a hotel that can be used as a family or as a couple with peace of mind. 52. Comment: Great hotel. Very clean and great food.|We were there for the second time and again we were happy. The guest managers Tulay and Aileen do a great job and organize everything possible for their guests.|It is also a paradise for children. Two ... 53. Comment: Although it was our first visit to the hotel, we were very pleased. The cleanliness, food, and friendly staff were enough for us. In addition, we would like to thank the animation team, thanks to whom our children had a great vacation. I hope to meet again in the coming years. 54. Comment: Best food and beverage concept I've seen so far. The staff is very friendly. The animation team is amazing. The physical condition and staff of the children's club are excellent. We spent a lot of time in the area and our daughter had a lot of fun. The garden is very well maintained and a very nice area to have a good time with various seating and relaxation areas. 55. Comment: I recently stayed at this beautiful hotel for about a week. Our experience was great. The staff were friendly and helpful. The all-inclusive food and beverage package was fantastic. They have daily activities for children from morning to night, including beach service at the pool, children's activities, circus nights, Brazilian music nights and more. there is Me and my family really enjoyed staying there. the sea view was beautiful, there are many interesting things in the middle of it. the service was great and the activities were endless and a once in a lifetime opportunity. it's very stylish and fun I highly recommend and hope to go there again in the future 👍🏻 56. Comment: First, all the staff were very friendly. Our son broke his arm on the day of his vacation. We wanted to cancel the holiday, but we couldn't, but we're glad we didn't. Thanks to the mini club, my son participated in many activities. Especially today they made cookies, the event went very well. My son did not want to leave the small club so much that we could not see him during the whole holiday :) The food is delicious and there is a lot of variety. You may get tired while choosing varieties :)))) There are snacks every 10 steps, so you don't have to wait in line. You won't go hungry. Our day is so full that the entertainment in the evening, although very beautiful and varied, unfortunately cannot be attended by fatigue. But if you do come, be sure to join the fun. As for cleanliness, the chefs immediately pick up the trash on the floor when they see it, but it would be better to clean the room and it's still not dirty or bad. We 100 percent plan to visit again. 57. Comment: My wife and I stayed at this hotel for the first time during our annual 5-day vacation. Overall, we were very satisfied, we have stayed in many 5 star hotels in Antalya, including congresses, and this is the first time we have met such caring staff. What we liked about the hotel was that most of the staff and guests were Turkish. In general, we felt very valued and entertained in our own country, and Russian or British tourists were looked after everywhere. The guests were mostly a family, which made us happy. For those who want, there are all kinds of entertainment, for example, holiday animation, although we did not have children, we enjoyed the children's activities :) The sea is very beautiful and clean, there were many places near the beach. buy snacks and serve drinks. Can't go hungry, my wife and I gained weight and came back :) The rooms are clean enough, the food is amazing, only the main restaurant is a bit small, that's the only bad thing we remember. We will choose again next year :) 58. Comment: I don't know where to start, but we had the best time we could have spent our honeymoon here. Being a hotel area, we were not sure which hotel to go to at first, but we told each other what a good decision we made when we came here. From the information at the reception to the cleanliness of the rooms, delicious food and activities, a 5 star business from start to finish. We would like to express our deepest gratitude to Mr. Seven, Mr. Tayfun and Yalçın for their interest and care, to Ms. Bahar from the entertainment team, and to the Concord family who always put a smile on the faces of the other staff. 59. Comment: Nice hotel with great staff! A great family place with a large beach and pool. There was great entertainment every night and we loved Brazil Night. Great food every day, buffet with restaurants if you want. The garden buffet is very good with variety. I would recommend this hotel to travelers of all ages. Also enjoyed a Turkish bath and a massage at the spa. 60. Comment: Variety of food, something for everyone! There is always something going on at the pool and the entertainment team are the best here, so friendly, welcoming and fun. The team includes everyone at all times for all games around the pool and beach. They put on a show every night and they are always out of this world amazing and never miss a beat. All in all, this is one of the best hotels we have stayed at (our third time) and will definitely be visiting again and again. 61. Comment: I definitely recommend it. Everything is perfect, we are on our honeymoon and we are still in the hotel. We beat the British in the water games, came first, and won a medal 🇹🇷 The animation team and hotel service are excellent. The pool is as big as the sea. The coach at the sports facility gave us individual attention and we practiced sports. I recommend. 62. Comment: This is the funnest hotel I've ever been to. A lot of fun. I mostly participated in daytime activities and had fun. Football, water polo, darts and fitness classes were very interesting. The evening shows were held at a professional level. Cleanliness and food were good. It has a large area and its large garden is amazing. 63. Comment: I am here for the first time and I am very satisfied. The animation is perfectly designed|A four-way offer in the program|The staff is very attentive and approachable|The staff is always asking about room service and hygiene and also … 64. Comment: I recently stayed at the Concorde Hotel and I can't say enough good things about my experience. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm smile and exceptional service. The staff went above and beyond to ensure my stay was comfortable and enjoyable. The rooms are spacious, clean and well equipped with all amenities. The bed was incredibly comfortable which ensured a great night's sleep. The decor was modern yet cozy which made me feel right at home. One of the highlights of my stay was the dining experience. The hotel restaurant offers a varied menu with delicious options for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Every dish I had was a culinary delight and the service was impeccable. Another advantage of the hotel is its convenient proximity to many attractions and public transportation, making it easy to explore the city. Despite being in a troubled area, the hotel itself was an oasis of calm. The facilities, including the fitness center and spa, were top notch. I enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa and took advantage of the well-equipped gym. Overall, the Concord Hotel exceeded my expectations in every way. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a luxurious and memorable vacation. I will definitely return on my next visit to the city. 65. Comment: First of all I would like to thank everyone for their interest. Our holiday was over, and it was as if we had woken up from a dream. All employees smile and are interested in everything, there is no employee who does not greet and smile when they meet. The variety of food was very good and the taste was amazing. You can't go hungry in the hotel, there are many kinds of food in every corner. There is a 24-hour bar, the drinks are excellent, you can enter it at any time, no matter which corner of the hotel you go to. The bartenders prepare their own special dishes according to your desired taste and they are truly amazing. In addition to the children's pool, there are +16 pools if you want to relax. The events and mini-competitions held in the main pool were fun. The evening events were also very good, but it would have been better if they didn't end so early (11:30 pm). The walking areas were really beautiful, everywhere was very clean and quiet. A hotel I will visit again, recommend to everyone, must visit. There was only one bad thing about the holiday, it was over ❤️ 66. Comment: We go there with friends, it was very cool and wonderful. Every day we had drinks, lunches and evenings by the pool, talking and doing activities. The food was good, the drinks and spirits were amazing. The staff were friendly and helpful. They all speak good English. The whole place was clean and like new. There are so many bars, snack bars, cafes and restaurants in the area that it's hard to choose. You need at least 6 days to chill and enjoy all the activities at Concorde Resort. The spa was clean and the abuse was professional. It is a good place to relax or have fun, you can enjoy it with friends or family, either way it has its own experience😊 67. Comment: The hotel's location may be the reason we chose it because it is close to the airport. I really enjoyed the attitude of Mr. Merdan in the lobby bar and Mrs. Sena and Bahar in the kids club towards my son and all their guests. Food quality is average but sufficient. The opening hours of snack bars may be extended until 6:00 p.m., but depending on the month of October, this may also be the case. The friendly attitude of all the staff is a favorable condition for this hotel located in the service sector. 68. Comment: Came here with my family (4 years old and 1 year old) - kids had a blast and it was a good family holiday. The rooms are very nice and the beds are comfortable. The food was good with variety and there were many shows every night. The staff were really nice and the girls in the kids club were the sweetest and very kind to both my kids. Little Bahar, Sena and Sarah were special in the Moppet Kids Club. The hotel is a 20-minute taxi ride to the famous Land of Legends, so it's perfect for those planning to travel there. The hotel is generally good and child friendly, which was the purpose of the trip. 69. Comment: It was a great time at the hotel, the staff were very helpful and attentive and always doing interesting things. A great hotel with lots of space, beautiful bars and lots of activities. All the pool staff (skaters and fun makers) were so fun and helpful! Lots of activities, making sure there's always something to do and never a lull, which was good for us and other families. Doruk on the skating team was especially great. The buffet restaurant had a wonderful staff, an older server in the 16+ section was very attentive to us during each meal. Overall a great experience and will come again next year. 70. Comment: The hotel is good, but it is an old hotel, so the building itself is poor compared to other standards. Food was good and varied, service was good. On the plus side, there is a nice, large garden and swimming pool, as well as a beautifully landscaped beach. There wasn't much animation, but maybe that's because we're out of season 71. Comment: Very good food and service. Grandpa from the entertainers was very accommodating and even hosted our beach volleyball game. Each evening there are different dishes and events at the dinner. We are not tired of diversity. Will definitely be back! 72. Comment: The hotel staff was very caring and friendly. All the dishes were delicious, thanks to the chefs. We had a great time with the animation team, especially thanks to Ata Bey. Of course, Ms. Aycha's professionalism in massage was amazing. 73. Comment: The resort is very well placed for everyone's needs, the staff are very friendly and helpful. Amazing selection of food and snacks. Our favorite spot was the beach pier where we spent most of our time. They performed very well in the theater. Molton Brown's favorite toiletries. We will definitely return in the future. 74. Comment: I recently had the opportunity to stay at a family run hotel and I have nothing but positive things to say! The whole atmosphere was very warm and perfect for families with children. The rooms were spacious and comfortable, which was very important to us as a family. Everything was clean and well maintained so we felt at home right away. The highlight of our stay was the variety of activities on offer for all age groups. Be it sports, craft classes or games - there was something for everyone. The animation team was really special! With great effort and creativity, they have created various programs that appeal to both children and adults. It was great to see the kids having fun and interacting with the other guests. The food was good and there was a huge selection so even picky eaters got their money's worth. Special kudos to the friendly staff who were always helpful and courteous. Overall, our stay at the hotel was very successful. I can only recommend it if you want to relax and have fun with your family! 75. Comment: After researching the hotel, the negative reviews are confusing, but we were very happy with our 1 week stay and would definitely consider coming again. The hotel has solved the food problem, the food and beverage service is unlimited at all times of the day and the system is fully installed compared to most hotels. Drinks are of high quality, everything was taken care of for families with children like us, we had no problems. The only negative thing is that the hotel can't do anything, the sea is a bit rough in this area and the deepening starts quickly, but the hotel has taken all precautions. The staff in all departments were caring and kind. Some comments said they weren't interested, but one has to wonder what the commenters expect from the staff. Anyone looking for a fun vacation can definitely choose the Green Zones, the service, quality food, and recreation facilities were some of the best hotels I've ever been to. I advise you to ignore the negative comments sometimes, because they can have various stomach problems. 76. Comment: I liked a lot. The room was clean, the food was great, the only issue I noticed was that there were no trays at the bars. The drinks were great, the environment was clean, the staff was very polite, which I really appreciate. The pool and nightly shows were also great. I will definitely come back. 77. Comment: Food and atmosphere were great. The pool was top notch. It was great talking to Grandpa from Funmakers! The ultra all inclusive experience was amazing! Every night the show was fun. Very nice hotel staff. Keep going! Arcade/bowling center may be modified but nothing else 78. Comment: We are very pleased. The food is great, the selection is huge and varied. Not so much in October. Very pleasant temperatures. Employees year. The hotel is very clean. You are not bothered by noise. 79. Comment: Great resort! Really friendly staff and amazing kids activities. The shows were great and a lot of fun for all of us. 5 out of 5 for me! The variety of food is amazing. Desserts are delicious. Cold baklava is a must. Massage and spa are really good. 80. Comment: I recently stayed at the Concorde Hotel and had a wonderful experience.

One is better than the other. The food is varied, the facility is well maintained and beautiful. Every staff member is very attentive and friendly!
