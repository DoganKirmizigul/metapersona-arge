1. Yorum: It was our best holiday. If possible, we would give this hotel 7*. I can recommend it to everyone, definitely go here once. We have been to many places in the world, but for us right now this place is in the first place. Cleanliness, programs, children have everything they want. The pools are amazing, huge, we've never seen them this big. The food is fantastic and amazing. The waiters are also very nice, I would highlight "Mujdan", sorry, I'm not sure if I spelled his name correctly, he is a real gentleman. The wellness department is also wonderful. The smell that permeates the entire hotel is fantastic. The gym is super well equipped with machines, which is very rare! We spent a very wonderful 7 days there. Thank you 2. Comment: We were extremely satisfied with everything. Great place! :) 3. Yorum: Wow, this exceeded all expectations. I have never been to a place where the place looks exactly like the pictures, if not better. The pool is simply stunning!!! I was never crowded and I always managed to get a good sunbed... 4. Comment: A positive thing is the very attentive and friendly staff, who immediately offered us a room upgrade without asking because of our baby, as the standard rooms are apparently small. ||The hotel complex itself is breathtakingly beautiful and very … 5. Comment: We booked this holiday when we wanted a well deserved break in the autumn sunshine...so glad we decided to come here! Having read some of the reviews beforehand, there were some that were disappointing… but… 6. Comment: We spent 10 wonderful days at the Mardan Palace. And it was one of the most wonderful vacations of our lives! We really liked everything. The location of the hotel is very convenient. The room is as comfortable as possible! Very willing, kind staff! We were satisfied with the excellent service. The food was simply amazing and varied! We will definitely return to the Mardan Palace many more times! And special thanks to Anastasia for her support and help! 7. Comment: Titanic Mardan Palace in Antalya offers a spacious and spacious hotel complex that is impressive at first glance. However, you can notice that the hotel is getting a little old – renovations here and there haven't hurt to bring it back to the old days... 8. Comment: The hotel is a bit dated, but classic and luxurious. On the point, from the dispenser in the pool and beach and from the bottle in the lobby, and in the Shiller cafe, juices are available per portion and most people do not understand English. The main restaurant lacks shrimp, but we found mussels, perch, squid, beef steak, and lamb on a few evenings. The juices are in the main restaurant's dispenser, but they vary in freshness. The water in the sea is about 1-2 degrees colder than in the neighboring hotels, because the mouth of the Lara River is right at the Titanic Mardan beach, although we did not feel any pollution. Sometimes I miss the music on the beach. The water in the pool is a bit cold. I wanted to feel a pleasant smell in the lobby, like other hotels like Selectum luxury Belek or Calista, Ela excellence, Voyage Belek and check-in at the desk, not at the reception, and they don't try to give me a different room than the one I paid for ! Among these hotels, overall, Titanic Mardan ranks last in our preference, but it is a very good hotel, value for money compared to many hotels, but below the above mentioned, it has many positive aspects, such as Amon spa, white sand on the beach, rooms are luxurious, lobby is luxurious and unique, beautiful terrace, good food, comfortable chairs on the beach and in the pool, but at the point you don't really get to the water, who doesn't rent a cabin, except at the end. Very good tasting cakes, good 24 hour restaurant, but the quality of the menu is not the same as Ela's more varied Didiscoteca, with good music and beautiful shows. Good a la carte food at Stella and Savor, with excellent pizza, the best coffee in the hotels, excellent music at the pool, especially in the evening, and a dreamy atmosphere with lights and beautiful views, especially from the tower. Gorgeous outdoor heated spa. Served in crystal glasses, including on the beach, silver cutlery and fine crockery. Immaculate beach. Gozleme only for breakfast. Some excellent waiters in the lobby, premium international drinks. What is missing is a restaurant on the beach with sofas and a DJ like Ela excellence or Calista, and this would be a concept worthy of Mardan Palace's reputation. They gave me the wrong phone number when I checked in and I didn't get any help via watsapp. But overall the best for the asking price. 9. Yorum: I am staying at the hotel for the time being, and I would like to describe in a few words what I have seen, experienced, and experienced so far. First let me start with the booking, I booked this hotel through Titanic Call Center and everything is fine... 10. Yorum: Staying at the hotel is a dream come true. The cozy rooms, the impeccable service and the stunning view from the windows create an atmosphere of complete relaxation. Each day began with programs and entertainment provided by the hotel. We would like to say a special thank you to the animation girl Veronika, who created a very friendly and cheerful atmosphere in all the activities we attended, a wonderful program and I especially liked the live music. We will definitely be back! 11. Comment: The complex is very big, nice beach, but there are not enough sunbeds, which are booked right before breakfast. Of course, you can rent cabins for a pittance, but 160-250 euros per day is already expensive. Beer and vodka on the 2 deckchairs next to us... 12. Yorum: Well, what a disappointment. After the initial wow factor of the reception, things quickly went downhill. |The magnificent staircase is covered with a carpet. The handles are missing/do not fit the doors. | The pool tile falls and the … 13. Comment: This hotel | It has the potential to be very good, but there are some serious issues that need to be addressed. The pool has many missing tiles in large areas around the pool a swim up bar and the Italian Ala Carte is rotten and into the pool … 14. Comment: I give 2 points only for the service at Xbanna, I am ready to give 5, the hotel is a Mardan relic, service 0 points, arrogant and stupid!!! They literally clean the room moderately, we stepped on the glass twice during our stay! There are no … 15. Comment: It was a wonderful experience to stay in this hotel for a week. The service was fantastic as was the selection of drinks and food. Plus, the pool view, cabana options, beach, and entertainment were all very enjoyable. The staff were very pleasant and we would like to give special mention to the bar staff in the lobby area and Yilmaz who works in the hotel dining room. We couldn't recommend this hotel enough! If you want a relaxing stay with beautiful weather and a luxurious feel, this is the ideal place! 16. Yorum: The impressions about the hotel are only positive. We've been here for a week now and in all that time we haven't seen a single person from the staff who didn't smile at us. Great service and great food in the restaurants. Drinks are brought by guys on roller skates, very quickly. We will definitely choose this hotel again for our next vacation. 17. Yorum: Wonderful hotel. I liked everything, food, drinks, beach, service. All our wishes were fulfilled. The staff is polite, friendly and positive. Gest Timur helped with advice and actions from the moment of arrival and continued. Thank you to the hotel for a great stay! We definitely want to come back) 18. Comment: We were very satisfied during our stay. An exact copy of the Maiden Tower was built, and the hotel was built on a large area. The food was top quality and the dessert buffet in particular was amazing. Sometimes the tables were not served and the staff could have been more attentive and friendly. We were very happy that the hotel was big and there was no fight for places in the pool or by the sea. The architectural structure gives the hotel a wonderful appearance. It has been thought through to the smallest detail. They pay a lot of attention to the wishes of the customers. We would also like to thank Mr. Timur, who took special care of us during check-in and check-out. I hope to see you again... 19. Yorum: I was in the hotel for the third time and everything got worse. There are better hotels for less. Most of the staff are so unwelcoming and very rude. We have had several cases where employees insulted us stupidly. We advertised on … 20. Comment: We have been to Mardan twice, we are going again in November!!! The first time was in November 2022. We arrived around 9pm and were completely satisfied with the meeting at the reception and hotel lobby. Of course... 21. Yorum: We had a great time at the hotel. Many thanks to all the workers. Especially the reception team was very warm. The guest relations department also looked after us during the holidays. A lot can be said about the hotel. I definitely recommend the hotel to everyone. If you want to spend the best vacation in the world, come here. 22. Yorum: Titanic Mardan Palace offers a magnificent palace atmosphere that embodies splendor and true luxury with its elegant design, where Seljuk and Ottoman architecture meets modern comfort, its central location decorated with works of art in every corner, large comfortable rooms to meet all needs, sumptuous views and large pool areas. When we arrived at the hotel early in the morning, we were warmly welcomed by the friendly staff and settled in our room around noon. First of all, the food was very delicious. There were options for every taste. This also applies to drinks; Well-known local and imported drinks were plentiful. Soft drinks and some alcoholic beverages such as beer were served in cans or bottles. The fitness room was great. As our holiday lasted only 5 days, I didn't have a chance to meet the animation team, but the shows and especially the evening entertainment at the Mycanos bar were excellent. Finally, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to ETS TUR and the hotel management for hosting us in a wonderful room like the "Presidential Suite" and providing us with wonderful accommodation even though we were given a family room. 23. Comment: This was the first time we stayed at this hotel. The hotel is simply beautiful, big, the area is huge and beautiful. They checked us into our room quite quickly, we got a two-story room, which is incomparable... 24. Comment: The food was good. We had a nice time. My family and I were very happy to come to this hotel. Very nice and wonderful hotel. The employees are always helpful. We were satisfied with the quality of the service. We recommend it to everyone. A week is really not enough for this hotel. We will come again. 25. Comment: This is a very nice and decent hotel with food, kids club, restaurant services and huge spa. The only minus is that you have to walk 15 minutes from the beach to the reception on a very large and not very bumpy road. A must-see hotel in Antalya Extremely suitable, especially for families with children. 26. Comment: I liked the hotel! Food, accommodation, animators - everything at the highest level! I spent the whole vacation with the animators Veronica, Dasha and Elina. It was very fun and exciting, there were many activities in the hotel, you will definitely not be without fun! I will definitely come back here again 😻 27. Comment: Good hotel but not ideal for families Overall we had a pleasant stay at this hotel. The rooms were clean and the staff friendly. The food was also very good and varied. However, we found that it is not ideal for families. The beach walk was quite long, which can be a bit tiring with children. It's certainly perfect for couples or solo travelers, but families might want to consider a longer walk along the beach. 28. Comment: The hotel is unique. We are excited about the food and desserts!!! The entertainer YAVUZ helped to get to know the other guests especially during the games (darts). It was very funny and super fun. We would love to come back. 29. Comment: The hotel is elegant, but the rooms are tired. Adults only must enter the dining room and pool. Why they insist on pumping club music around the pool for 9 hours a day I have no idea it's not necessary. The staff are all very pleasant. It's a wilderness out there, and it's not pleasing to the eye. Would I go again? No due to the above concerns. 30. Comment: The hotel and the complex are very remarkable and of a very high standard. The service staff could be a little more attentive and friendly. The quality of the rooms, especially the structure of the complex, is very remarkable. The food was the best so far, including the patisserie. 31. Comment: We chose this hotel as the meeting place for our parents as we all live in different countries. We stayed in the Lake House room (2 bedrooms), which can accommodate a maximum of 5 adults. |I liked everything, good... 32. Comment: We stayed at this hotel for the first time. I really liked everything. Excellent cuisine. I would like to specially mention the guest relations department – ​​administrator Anastasia. Help with trips, tips for organizing leisure activities outside the hotel, extensive evening program, live music. 33. Yorum: We came to Turkey for the fifth time and really liked the hotel. The area of ​​the hotel is large. The sea and sand are beautiful and the bottom does not sink The hotel has a beautiful design, especially the palace design in the lobby. The food in the main restaurant is very tasty and the service is also good. We hope to see you again until we meet again. 34. Comment: The hotel provides a great welcome, champagne and friendly staff upon arrival. From the entrance to the end of our vacation, there were assistants who answered all our questions. There is plenty of food everywhere, grocery stores are open all day, you will definitely not go hungry here. The evening program is very good, there is live music and shows, a themed disco. We even sat in the a la carte restaurant with a magnificent view. We generally recommend it to everyone and will definitely be back. 35. Comment: The rooms in the European wing are better than in the Asian wing, brighter and more spacious. Access to the sea is not the best, the water is dirty. The food is excellent, the buffet is 10 out of 10. The service is great, the activities are interesting, I would like to see more and at different times, there were times when I wanted to visit both, but the time was the same. The animators are excellent, very friendly and sociable. I especially liked darts, bocce and fly yoga. I mention the great guys: Mehmet, Veronica, Valeria, Daria. Good luck to them in their work and an additional bonus :) 36. Comment: Exceptional hospitality that seamlessly combines luxury and comfort. The help of the guests, especially from Sabrina, was outstanding, her professionalism and attentiveness made our stay truly memorable. The general … 37. Yorum: We rested at this hotel for the first time. I liked everything very much. Excellent cuisine I would like to mention the guest relations department - administrator Anastasia. He helped with excursions, gave advice on leisure activities outside the hotel, a wide evening program, live music. 38. Comment: Great hotel. You feel at home, it's so hot and warm here. The staff is friendly and caring. Special thanks to Anastasia, the pregnancy assistant, for her care, attention and friendliness. We come for the second time and Anastasia always helps us, she is very attentive. I suggest you contact him! Prosperity hotel!!! 39. Comment: The best hotel, the staff solves all problems, requests and wishes in seconds. he is simply the best of the best❤️ Our family would like to thank the hotel staff for a wonderful vacation. We are very pleased with the attention and care of the hotel staff. Like all hotels, it has its drawbacks: for example, the beach is very small and cramped. 40. Yorum: The hotel is simply amazing! As someone who often goes to Antalya on vacation with his family, I can say that this was the most luxurious hotel we have ever stayed at. We loved the masterful detailing of every corner of the hotel. The fact that its concept is Istanbul, it offered us as Istanbulites a very nostalgic holiday option. All the staff provided the best service I have ever seen. In particular, the reception colleagues and guest relations were attentive and fulfilled all our requests 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. We really liked how friendly and cheerful they were. The food was simply amazing. We look forward to trying the A La Carte restaurants next time. Many thanks to everyone at the hotel for giving us such a wonderful experience. We are definitely looking forward to coming back next year! 41. Comment: Wonderful hotel! Our first time on vacation, we were greeted by very friendly staff upon arrival. The room was beautifully cleaned and ready for an early check-in. We had a great time at the hotel. The hotel kitchen works great, you won't go hungry. The bars also have an excellent selection of drinks. 42. Comment: Very satisfactory. 10 days of pure relaxation. I would have liked to stay longer. Luxury, pleasure and professional service throughout the hotel. Especially in the SPA area and the beef restaurant. |Thank you for everything Titanic Mardan Palace. See you next year :-) 43. Comment: This is a wonderful hotel for a family vacation. This is the second time and we would go again. Lots of fun for kids and adults alike. The food is excellent. There is plenty to offer in the various restaurants and bars etc. in the resort. The service is mostly very good, there are staff who obviously lack either training or perhaps enthusiasm, but they generally take good care of you. Overall, I think it would be very difficult not to have a wonderful time. 44. Comment: The staff is very helpful, they do everything to help you. The rooms are cleaned daily and the fridges are stocked daily Premium drinks are available which are taken by the skate bar staff The pool is huge and spacious sabrina helped us book our La cart restaurant and went out of her way to help us with a few things. I highly recommend Hotel 45. Comment: There were cockroaches in the Tower restaurant and the service was very unfriendly. We were here for the fifth time in a row, but what we experienced at Friedman's shocked us. Me and my husband will not come to this hotel again. The hotel has clearly lost its class. It's a shame because we've been very happy in recent years. 46. Comment: This is not the first time we have stayed at the hotel. We went there with my family 2 years ago. Some points have changed, but this is not a minus, as there is something to compare it to. The hotel staff are trying hard and it is clear that renovation is needed. At the same time, the atmosphere of comfort remains, cleanliness and care are present. The food is just as amazing as our last visit. We wish the hotel to grow and develop. We are considering coming next year. 47. Comment: This is our first time staying at the hotel. The impressions are amazing! A beautiful design that is simply unreal, like something from a fairy tale. We have a great time and are constantly busy with both sports and entertainment. There is a bowling alley, and the children's animation will keep the kids busy! We definitely recommend this hotel to everyone 48. Comment: We chose this hotel as the meeting place for our parents as we all live in different countries. We stayed in the Lake House room (2 bedrooms), which can accommodate a maximum of 5 adults. I liked everything, good food, excellent service in the restaurants and on the beach, excellent concierge service. Turkish coffee and tea deserve special attention. The hotel area is very easy to navigate. It is very convenient that everyone speaks Russian (my parents are abroad for the first time and do not speak other languages). The downside is that you have to pay extra for the a la carte restaurants, but the prices are reasonable. 49. Comment: Excellent hotel, 5 stars in my opinion. Quality from the rooms to the food and entertainment.||What stood out was the service and politeness throughout the hotel, except for the usual bartender in the night show area.||The … 50. Yorum: This was our first holiday in Mardan. Everything was great from the entrance to the end of the holiday. The sea is incomparable! We had a good rest. We are not picky when it comes to food, there is a wide selection of food, meats and vegetables for every taste. We came for the peace and relaxation that we got at the hotel 51. Comment: One star is still too much for this hotel. Unfortunately, this was my worst experience. I don't know if it's the new managers or the general management, but the employees are demotivated and avoid contact with guests to avoid asking them about something. You have to ask for something small several times in the hope that after the third or fourth try you can get it right. The 1. from day one, there was no cot in the room, although it is clear whether guests arrive with children. The safe was broken from the beginning, and despite reporting it three times to the reception, no one came to fix it. The torn curtain was ignored despite repeated notifications. The cleanliness of the cutlery was poor and for a hotel of this size the food selection is shockingly limited. Ordering drinks at the pool was a challenge - staff seemed demotivated and even rude at times. All in all we paid a lot of money but got hardly anything in return. The only positives were the original drinks and the bed. This hotel has a lot of room for improvement - but unfortunately it is not recommended in this state. 52. Comment: Great hotel. The neighborhood is beautiful with a swimming pool. Beach Excellent. The only thing that spoiled the vacation was the fact that there were lots of hungry cats in the area. Which management refuses to feed. We fed them ourselves about the caring attitude towards animals, especially cats, in Turkey. But as it turns out, this is not the case. Such a luxurious hotel and such a shade really spoiled the impression. I would like them to take this into consideration and take action on feeding and neutering stray cats. 53. Yorum: I recently vacationed at the Titanic Mardan hotel and had only positive impressions. There are many different activities here: I especially liked bocce and darts. This is a great opportunity to relax and have fun. When it comes to food, the hotel's restaurants offer an incredible variety of dishes. The quality of the food is top notch - from fresh seafood to delicious desserts. The service is also of the same standard: the staff is always attentive and helpful. Special thanks for the animation, especially Veronika and Elina❤️❤️❤️ In general, our stay at Titanic Mardan left only positive emotions. I recommend it to everyone who wants comfort and great fun! 54. Yorum: Here is the most beautiful hotel I have visited in my life. We came for my dad 2 years ago and started coming every year. The rooms are very clean and the entertainment is great. They let me play the piano and the drinks are great and the food is so so. I would like to have waffles delivered to the cafe in the morning. I attended the mini kids club disco and the daily activities are very entertaining for the kids and I hope Beyonce or other celebrities like Arianna Grande Biillie Eilish come to this hotel. Thank you everyone. Especially the animator Esra. 55. Comment: Excellent hotel, clean, very chic, huge pools, clean warm water 👍, evening concerts, discos are great! Alcohol is only imported and has no analogues, there are only eight types of bottled beer. On the beach, the beach is also five-star ☝️👍 the staff is excellent, almost everyone speaks or understands Russian 🖐👌 I recommend a 7-star hotel on this beach 🔥 56. Yorum: When I came to the hotel in winter, I was impressed and chose it for a summer vacation, but unfortunately it was AWFUL! The office manager of the hotel, a person named Huriye Nehir, used unspeakable insults and tones to cover up his colleague's mistake. Like Mardán, who didn't even bother to listen to his grandmother and ruined my vacation, I was very saddened that such a person was placed in this position in such a corporate place. The fact that she is a woman, more than a person working in the service sector, has a disgusting attitude, talks to me without restraint, claims that she is the highest ranking person in the hotel and stubbornly does not let me meet anyone. further. I left the hotel in a panic attack. She ruined my vacation. 57. Comment: Everyone 👋🏻 ||We stayed at the Titanic Mardan Palace hotel and we were very impressed! || I would especially like to mention the work of the animation team - the guys really made our vacation unforgettable🤩🤩🤩||Continuously... 58. Comment: The Titanic Mardan Palace Hotel and Teen Club simply amazes with the variety of entertainment options it offers for teenagers. My experience at the hotel was unforgettable due to the cozy atmosphere and attentive service. The teen club has friendly animators who are always ready to entertain young people and surprise them with new ideas - from themed parties to interesting competitions and games. The teenagers enjoyed every moment they spent in the club, meeting new friends and immersing themselves in the fun atmosphere. I would especially like to note the professionalism of the staff and their concern for the safety and comfort of the young people. I was able to enjoy my vacation with peace of mind, knowing that my children were under the close supervision of experienced staff. I can confidently recommend the Titanic Mardan Palace hotel and their teen club to everyone who appreciates the quality of service, varied entertainment and family safety. Thank you for the wonderful experience! 59. Comment: Great hotel! Checked in very conveniently. The room has everything, if something is missing, you can contact the guest assistants at any time, they fulfill all requests perfectly and quickly. It was important for us to stay in a quiet room and the reception fulfilled this requirement 💯 the food selection is excellent! We have 60 more to come. Yorum: Thank you very much for the warm welcome, we came with a big family from Kazakhstan and we were glad that we chose your hotel because we like to relax here!

I would especially like to praise the Marha restaurant. Really first class! ||Ms. His friendly nature makes him an asset to the guest service. I would like one more time … 62. Comment: The place is absolutely amazing and the last word is "terrible", they were of good quality and very fantastic and each dish is more distinct than the other with its dishes impressing more than the last. The snacks are very varied and tasty. The rosaries... It is a very big pool and there is a small children's pool. the kids games are amazing the kids club is very nice and the activities are very nice above it is excellent if there is more i have given the price correctly but god almighty he deserves all the money he is asking me your eyes are closed and god willing i will visit again . 63. Yorum: We come from Antep. This is our last day at this hotel. 3. Our arrival. Of course, we choose this hotel every year because of the friendliness of the staff and the delicious food. They make legendary desserts and burgers. We spend almost all our time in the mini club. Everything is going great. We would like to thank the staff and the Animator Esra who takes great care of us every time we visit. 64. Comment: A wonderful environment where you can spend a family vacation. They thought of everything. Each dish is extremely delicious, service and service are at the highest level. The employees are very friendly and enjoy their work. There are plenty of activities for children. We were very satisfied with my family, if you want to feel at home, of course Titanic Mardan Palace Hotel🧡 65. Comment: Very cool hotel!!! We rested in the villa, everything was great 👍🏻 I would especially highlight the hotel's animation and sports activities. Yoga and pilates classes were simply wonderful, I enjoyed going every morning) The whole family played darts, which I really liked, played water polo, volleyball and boccia (all the animators were positive, it was pleasant to talk with them, enthusiastic, in general the time passed interestingly and I didn't realize how quickly 21 days passed). We also danced with the animation girls in the club, which was very cool, we were filled with energy. My little sister also went to a mini club, where she spent all her time with interests (making perfume, drawing mugs, t-shirts, sculpting from clay, etc.). not available in all hotels. The service is also excellent! I was pleasantly surprised to see a man cleaning everyone's glasses. Overall, this trip was amazing! 66. Comment: It was the greatest experience ever! the staff is extremely nice and helpful, actually anticipating needs just by... incredible! all equipment is excellent, fantastic comfort! We have been going to Turkey for 17 years, but this was the most beautiful experience in 67. Yorum: Wonderful hotel. My best holiday in Turkey. All staff members are polite, helpful and very kind. The roller waiters were especially brilliant every day. A wonderful hotel and would recommend it to anyone. 68. Comment: Excellent hospitality with a luxurious atmosphere. The staff is extremely professional and attentive, making every guest feel special. Special thanks to Miss Sabrina, whose kindness and exceptional service really stood out, ensuring a memorable stay. I highly recommend this hotel for an unforgettable experience. 69. Comment: I don't understand why this place hasn't been sued for a scam like this before. I'll bet you money that these good reviews are fake because no one who visits here is happy. The place is so old, real mold in the pool, air conditioning in the rooms doesn't work. The furniture is so dirty and old. It is advertised as all inclusive and when you get there they tell you that you have to pay extra for the restaurants. And the workers make fun of you for being American and don't want to serve you. Save yourself money and DO NOT GO HERE!!! 70. Comment: Absolutely amazing! Very good service. Delicious food and drinks. Excellent entertainment. Fantastic kids club. Amazing swimming pools, water parks, private beach. Shows for children and adults every evening. This place makes you feel like you never want to leave. 71. Comment: 6072-ES SZOBA. I will never come here and bring people again. We visited the Titanic Mardan Palace in Antalya at the same time last year and it was such an incredible experience that we decided to return this year with two families who usually stay at the Maxx Royal. Based on last year's experience, we convinced them to try Titanic, but now I really regret it. First, the check-in process was a disaster. After being told to come to reception twice to get our room, we finally got it at 2pm. There are no slippers in the room either - a basic expectation of a luxury hotel. We decided to avoid the main restaurant and instead booked the à la carte options at extra cost, but the quality dropped dramatically. The Italian restaurant didn't even have traditional Italian food like pasta or pizza - how is that possible in an Italian restaurant? The once decent Bistro is now a complete joke. Instead of high-quality dishes such as salmon and lamb, they serve pizza, burgers and fries. Frankly, for the amount we paid, this is unacceptable. The evening entertainment also decreased. The formerly lively program has become dull and uninspired, and the Mykonos bar, once a favorite of younger guests, now looks like a retirement lounge with outdated jazz. There is already a jazz lounge for that! We were also disappointed by the so-called "Go Go" dancers. There were only two of them and they looked more like waitresses than performers. They couldn't engage the crowd at all. Those live acts on the bridge we loved last year? Past. Now they just play music through a stereo system. It is clear that the management is no longer interested in quality entertainment. To make matters worse, the CEO was incredibly rude. When we voiced our concerns, he essentially told us, "We have enough guests without you." As a businessman myself, I would heartily fire him for this kind of behavior. We also noticed a scam regarding room categories. Two of the three rooms we booked in the same category were completely different. When we asked for a room they told us to come the next day only to ask for extra money to change. Shady. Finally, they charge 15 euros per hour to play wallball. Really? It's ridiculous for such a high paying hotel to have guests nickel and dime for a simple game of squash, especially when they offer free badminton rackets. The Titanic Mardan Palace has completely lost its touch. The service, quality of food, entertainment and overall experience has declined to such an extent that I will never recommend this hotel again and my friends staying at Maxx Royal will never return. Save yourself the disappointment and look elsewhere! 72. Yorum: We come from Istanbul. Today is the 2nd. our day. The food is very delicious. We are having a great time. For the first time. The desserts in the restaurant are great. As for the interior of the hotel, the interior design of the hotel is very beautiful and very stylish. I made great friends in the mini club. Different people from different countries in different languages ​​thank you all. especially animators Nastya Mishutova and Esra. ❤️❤️❤️❤️ 73. Comment: Such a beautiful hotel. This is definitely 5* and worth every penny. The staff caters to all needs. Super attentive. The pool is fantastic. Sunbeds are always available. Poolside bar staff come on roller skates and take your order so you never have to leave your seat. Everything is very clean. Excellent menu every night so we were never bored with the variety available. What a great experience and I will definitely be back with my family. 74. Yorum: Where do I start? The hotel is a hidden gem. Beautifully decorated inside and out. Probably the biggest swimming pools in Europe are here. The rooms are large, clean and impressive. The restaurants are all of the highest standard and all the staff I encountered were friendly and helpful. If you watch YouTube videos of the hotel, that's exactly what you get. 75. Yorum: It was nice to be here with my family! The hotel is very clean, the food is delicious and everything is well organized. There is also something for the children to do, the children's club is very good! There are enough activities for everyone and a lot of attention is paid to the children. I definitely want to come back here someday! 76. Comment: The service and attention of the staff from the entrance to the exit was very kind, but we are glad that a very friendly and caring lady helped a lot, I would like to say a special thank you. The waiters are attentive and friendly, fast and attentive, the menu is wide, the pools are big and more than enough, the hotel is very big, a bit tiring, but that's a negative on the positive side :) 77.

Comment: I can't believe Deanna's review I'm here right now and I'm a total freak..... not dirty or old, but fabulous. The hotel staff are spotless, clean constantly and work hard to provide excellent service. The only thing I can agree with is that you have to pay a premium for the finer restaurants. However, the food is fantastic at the other restaurants. The above are definitely not fake reviews because everyone we've spoken to so far thinks it's amazing here. We will definitely be back. 81. Yorum: It was a real pleasure to stay in this beautiful, majestic hotel with very good food and friendly staff. A big thank you to Sabrina, Nur and Gonul❤️ the pillars of the hotel who have always been there. for us and I'm sure for many other customers, a big thank you to the lobby bar (Huseyin Barman) and Pinar the waitress.

The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the hotel facilities greatly contributed to the enjoyment of our vacation. It was the perfect place to relax and unwind in a peaceful environment. We will definitely come again! 83. Comment: It was a great experience for us, the food at the hotel was very good, especially the lasagna and baklava were excellent, far superior to many other places I have eaten. The evening shows were beautiful and pleasing to the eye. The hotel uses a quality service approach. The guest relations staff were understanding and solution-oriented. I can't wait to come again. 84. Yorum: It was a wonderful week in this hotel. Highly recommend, great service, drinks and food. We tried the a la carte steak and the Japanese, both were amazing. The room was very comfortable and had everything we needed, including Molton Brown toiletries, but it was quite small. 85. Comment: Never again to the Mardan Palace!! |I am a young man, 30 years old, and I wanted to shave my head, beard and ear hair.|Usually from 10€ to a maximum of 30€ in a luxury place. Before I knew it, there was wax in my nose and the … 86. Yorum: We came with my 11-year-old daughter. The taste of the food, the atmosphere and the service really exceeded my expectations. There are so many details to describe, but it won't fit here. My daughter and I are never bored and we are happy. The smiling faces and helpfulness of the staff made me feel very comfortable. There is no different treatment of Turks than foreigners in other hotels. The evening animation and dance shows were attentive and entertaining. This is one hotel I will come back to again. Thanks for everything. 87. Comment: We had an excellent stay at this hotel, we really liked everything, this is the second time we have stayed here. Very varied food in the buffet, well-kept yard and nice staff! 88. Comment: Ms. Mahshid is very interested in guests who know his work. He listens patiently. He is friendly and polite, you are lucky to have a hotel, the food is very nice and big, only the children can come and go in the sauna. without their parents, and in the sauna, the heated stones must be covered with a board. The lobby is nice, the employees are very good The shows are nice The lady of the hotel, Nazli, does her job very well... The lady is Sevda Sponge. the lady in the room service is very good and skilled and understands her job. 89. Comment: My family and I had a great vacation at the hotel. All staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and comfortable. The activities and services offered specifically for children are excellent … 90. Yorum: "Everything was perfect during our stay. We were very impressed with the cleanliness of the hotel, the friendliness of the staff and the services it offers. Cozy and comfortable rooms, delicious food and a wonderful view... Everything made our vacation unforgettable. We will definitely come another time and recommend it to our friends." 91. Comment: The hotel is simply amazing service and top notch staff. The food is excellent, better than other hotels. 92. Comment: I would like to write my opinion about this wonderful hotel. 2024. we rested from May 17 to May 26. When choosing the hotel, I was guided by many positive reviews, so I knew that the hotel would not disappoint, but it exceeded all our expectations: a huge area, a lot of greenery, guest assistants who solve all problems as quickly as possible. , friendly staff at every stage of interaction with the guest. The hotel offers plenty of entertainment for children, including one of the best kids' clubs we've ever been to (and we've had a lot of them) - a separate area with its own show programs that don't overlap with adult events. The children were very impressed by the animators Esra and Yana, who not only do their job, but also make the children happy to the maximum, the programs and master classes (pottery workshop, wood workshop, T-shirt painting) that the guys organized for the children. he left no one an indifferent child. The on-site food is also organized at the highest level, the variety and quality of the products does not leave anyone indifferent on hot days, especially with freshly squeezed fruit juices, a variety of cocktails and fruits for all tastes. By the way, the alcohol in the hotel is also of very good quality. I would especially highlight the evening programs: interesting programs, guest artists, bright and colorful programs. Club lovers and concert connoisseurs will love it. We would like to thank all the staff for our wonderful vacation, both children and adults were very satisfied, we will definitely return to TITANIC MARDAN PALACE. 93. Comment: This hotel is absolutely phenomenal. Very beautiful with lots of gold, artwork and marble. Everything is so luxurious. The cocktails are first class, the service impeccable. The private help was very useful and helpful, they helped me with every little question uz. The food is amazing, so tasty and changes daily in the main restaurant. Snack bars offer great options and variety. There were always sunbeds and the pool, plenty of towels for the sunbeds. The spa was so luxurious with beautiful pools, relaxation rooms and saunas. I could go on and on, but this is the best hotel I have ever been to. The evening entertainment is absolutely wonderful. The only downside is the nightclub as the music can't be beat at times as it's very heavy house and dance music, no known songs which meant people went home early and you couldn't really dance to it. 94. Comment: Amazing service, clean, luxurious and very comfortable. ||||This is our second trip here in 6 months and we have already booked to go back in 2025. It has absolutely everything we need with amazing food and entertainment for the children. See you in 2025. 95. Yorum: We would like to thank the hotel and the service provided in the hotel. Nice, clean and fun. We liked the adult animation. interesting shows, parties. There is also a very good kids club, the girls are animators who love their work. Thanks to Nastya, Esra and Alina. 96. Comment: Slow service in all bars, slow service on the Bosphorus, cocktails not very impressive and side dishes often missed. The reception staff were very friendly but we found many of the staff in the bars to be cold and rude. Slow service and rude staff really let this hotel down. 97. Yorum: We came here for the sixth time. We love this hotel, the staff is nice, the staff is not so attentive, but we still come and recommend to the guest assistant, Timur, also a decision. 98. Comment: We chose this hotel this year on the recommendation of many friends and acquaintances. First of all, the food at all the restaurants was a culinary delight and the best thing we have ever eaten. The cooks 1a. This is also the reason why this hotel received 2 stars overall. Breakfast service was a total disaster. Some people were constantly on their mobiles, others just didn't feel like working, I think!!! The cleanliness of the rooms also left a lot to be desired. The visible areas were always clean, but the hidden areas (see pictures) from day one! This is not satisfactory at all! They responded quickly to our request to bring us new towels and bathrobes, but half were missing. Honestly, I don't feel like constantly checking my usual cravings when I'm on vacation. Although we complained on the second day, there was no improvement. We booked cabins for two days. The cleanliness here also leaves something to be desired. For 130 euros a day, I expect much better cleanliness. For example, the fridge handle in Cabana 25 was very dirty and very dusty!! We are very disappointed and will definitely not visit this hotel again! It's a shame that you expect higher quality for such money. Unfortunately, your hotel didn't do it justice! 99. Comment: The hotel is great. The staff is very respectful, caring and very friendly. You can feel that you have arrived at a truly quality place. We couldn't use the hotel's services in 5 days, but even the day wasn't enough :). On the negative side, there was too much sand on the pool floor and we could see oils on the water. The cleaning of the pool could be better. The cooling of the rooms is great. The double bed was uncomfortable because it had separate bases. Sometimes the beds had to be made. The music playing in the pool is also terrible :) Other than that, the food, drinks, sunbeds and water sports were very good. Recommended. 100. Comment: We were satisfied with everything. The activities were very good. Especially for children. The tiny kids club was very good. We were very satisfied with the restaurant, food and drinks. We really liked the desserts. I recommend this hotel to everyone. We will come again. 101. Comment: Great rooms and service, amazing hotel with amazing all inclusive. The only down side is that the entertainment went down a bit, but the kids club is also the best we've seen. 102. Comment: We stayed at the Mardan Palace Hotel for 6 days. Our room was a deluxe room. It was very big and clean. The equipment of the room was great. The hotel is also very big and clean. They have programs for children every night. There are night shows and parties every night. The variety of sweets and drinks was good, but the variety of food was not enough in my opinion. There were also few competition and entertainment programs by the pool, and it would have been better to have more fun programs by the pool during the day. 103. Comment: The animations were amazing, the piano playing in the lobby was especially great. I don't usually eat fish, but I started eating fish because of the fish restaurant. The staff are very friendly and every imaginable facility is top quality 104. Yorum: In short, everything is great, but the sea sucks. There is a large river nearby and the water is green if there are no waves bringing fresh water from the sea. So the rooms are big, expensive and rich, but tired. Data protection is quite high, we were in the main building in 2024, we didn't see any neighbors, we were alone in the elevator, we never waited. The restaurant always had good outdoor seating. We rented a tent on the pier during the day, we were there in July and the water was good. The service is generally good and friendly. Compared to 2023, noticeable savings can be achieved, while the price remains unchanged. 105. Comment: We came to the hotel for the first time and had a great time as a family. Everything was perfect. Thanks to everyone who contributed. I would especially like to thank one of my colleagues, guest assistant Timur. 106. Comment: I wanted to give 3* for boring evening shows with amateur level African and Cuban dances. But today we attended the Fashion of house evening show and we changed our mind that the show was modern and catchy. Well done guys. Organizers - please invite the same modern and talented groups as Fashion of house more often! The rooms have wet bedding due to the high humidity, and the air conditioners cannot handle it. The service is excellent, I haven't seen this in a long time. The food is good buffet, the a la carte restaurants are not about anything, the same food as in the main restaurant, but for money. 107. Comment: My family and I arrived at the Titanic Mardan Palace, we are already very satisfied!) The food in the restaurant is delightful, delicious and varied every day! The rooms are clean and the staff is very nice and polite. The animation program is great, there is always something to do and have fun. We met girls from the teen club Zarina, Alina, Rana, you are amazing, you immediately pulled us into your community and introduced us to the other guys!! The evening shows and parties are great! I want to come back here again and again) 108. Comment: This is the first time we stayed at Mardan Palace Hotel before being transferred to the hotel. And the hotel is huge, the design is elegant (in the style of the "Magnificent Century"). The food is very delicious!!! We express our thanks to the waitress Gul, who is a professional in her field, knows three languages, give her a promotion! 109. Comment: This is our first visit to the hotel, the transport is very good, it is centrally located. The location of the hotel was the most important thing for us. We were very satisfied with everything, but the children were the happiest. The Teen Club is very nice. There are always different activities. The mini disco evening shows are very nice. Thank you very much Ms. To Yasemin and Ayşenur. They are very kind and caring 110. Comment: The hotel is amazing with high quality outdoor furniture |Food is excellent and varied ||Sabrina's welcome was fantastic ||The improvement is still on the service.|The buffet restaurant service is difficult and slow, few … 111. Comment: Excellent hotel. We had a wonderful two stays and everything was perfect. Our guest assistants Faryar and Maschid were so friendly and helpful. We visited the spa several times - Murat the spa salesman was great. He entertained us every day. Food and drinks were amazing 112. Comment: The best hotel we've been to. The food, the service, the rooms are impeccable. The entertainment was great, especially the shows, the staff were very good. This hotel deserves more than 5 stars. We had a wonderful stay and would love to return in the future ❤️ 113. Comment: As someone who has stayed in many premium hotels, we were very satisfied with everything. The rooms and pools are very good, I think the only shortcoming is that the lighting in the rooms is very weak and the connecting door of the silo rooms is not closed. I would especially like to thank Mr. Arda, Kuzey and Doğan at the Pool Bar, whose names I remember, Mr. Hüseyin at the Main Restaurant, all the staff at the Mykonos Restaurant and the cat-friendly chefs (for their sensitivity to kitties) for their honesty and interest. 114. Comment: The animation is perfect. There is plenty of food and activities. We are happy to be here. This is a beautiful and wonderful place. Seymanur is a good girl, we played volleyball together. I love how people interact with us. The service here is really professional. 115. Comment: I really like this hotel, the animation team is very fun and professional, Mrs. SEYMANUR provided me baccarat and card games, very good and friendly animator. The food is fresh and tasty, I love it here. Our room is cleaned every day with clean linen and fresh drinks. 116. Comment: A very nice hotel in terms of its location and architecture. The sunbeds are very comfortable and despite the number of guests there are enough sunbeds for everyone. The pools are large and refreshingly cold. The service is also very good. The staff and animators take very good care of the guests. The food is always fresh and very tasty. Especially the pizzas are at the Italian level. This is my third visit and I am satisfied as always. 👍🏽 117. Yorum: Bad hotel for the price. The rooms are actually spacious and beautiful, but the room we stayed in the first night was not clean. We changed rooms and our cot was only brought there at 11 at night (after a few reminders). The beach is small but clean and the sand is beautiful. The food is very good. We have had various experiences with the Kids-Club. We were very pleased with some of the staff and activities. For example, our children had a lot of fun with the ceramics and accessories. Especially Ms. Dilek, Seda and Esra, Yana and Yagmur were very helpful. However, there were also grumpy, unhelpful staff. All in all, not a bad hotel, but in our opinion, not a hotel worth 500-600 EUR per day. 118. Comment: I came to this hotel 3 years ago, I paid 6k for all inclusive for 2 adults and 3 children, it was worth it at that time because the hotel was the best, but now they almost beat the price because the staff doesn't care about anyone. When it comes to housekeeping, they want to come in when they want and say they don't understand English because who says they understand English. They have a lot of different pools but it takes a while to get to the kids pool and everyone on the beach is scammed so please avoid them. 119. Yorum: I have been in the hotel for a week and overall I am very satisfied. However, there is still room for improvement. When we checked into the hotel, we were not informed about anything, they didn't say anything about the hotel, so we had to figure out for ourselves how to get by. The main restaurant was generally very nice and the food was also very tasty. But the tables were very cheaply decorated, which does not suit the concept of the hotel at all. Instead of cheap plastic rugs, you could have used nice tablecloths and nicer salt and pepper shakers. The cleanliness of the tables was also poor as they were not wiped down properly and those plastic mats were also not cleaned properly. What I didn't like was that when I ordered something from one waiter, another waiter brought the drinks. Even though we were in a hotel, we live in times where you want to know who's bringing what. The rooms were also fine, I have nothing to say about the cleanliness, except that they often forgot to change the towels. I personally found the cafe very good. The drinks were very tasty. It reminded me a bit of Starbucks. You could also play darts there, which was a lot of fun. The pools were huge, which is a plus because you don't have to stick directly to others. The sunbeds at the pool were also very clean and comfortable. It was also nice to be able to order drinks for the lounger. The waiters then came on roller skates to hand out the drinks, which was very amusing to watch. I just found it really boring because there wasn't any decent music or anything like that. The beach was generally very nice, but there were too few sunbeds, which was very annoying. You can see that this hotel is trying to squeeze more money out of people's pockets as it is a strategy that rents out more of these beach houses. I would not like to come to this hotel again, just because of the position of the sunbeds on the beach. It is questionable how it is during the whole high season, when there are even more guests in the hotel. What I didn't like were the umbrellas on the beach that couldn't be closed, so you always had to move the deckchairs, which are very heavy, back and forth. Overall it was a pleasant stay, but there are plenty of hotels in the area that offer better value for money. For the money we paid, I would not choose this hotel again. Sometimes you wait 40 minutes for your drink, which is not very nice at 30 degrees. There's really nothing outside the hotel so it's very secluded from the outside world. So you have to take a taxi to go shopping. However, you have to be careful not to be ripped off by taxi drivers. First, they wanted 30 euros from me for a 13-minute drive. After I threatened to call the police, it was only 500 lira. On the way back I only paid 450 Lira with the night rate and probably still got ripped off on the way there. In the last days of our stay, a large family of about 20 people arrived, who felt very uncomfortable and somehow took over the entire hotel, which the hotel itself could not do anything about. Overall, I found the entertainment at the hotel quite boring. Some of the evening programs were no longer suitable for young people, where advance warning should have been given. The music at the parties was always the same and bad. The area where the performances take place is very poorly furnished. If someone is sitting in front of you, you can no longer see anything and can only listen. Perhaps an amphitheater would have made more sense so that everyone could see something. The food at the 24 hour restaurant was delicious, although some orders were forgotten. The minibar selection was very good and left nothing to be desired. 120. Comment: We rested from 07/09-09/24 Excellent, nice hotel, food 5+, especially sweet, nice rooms, good cleaning, excellent service. they are friendly, they know their jobs well: in the Bosphorous-Gul restaurant, in the Stella-Mehmed restaurant and in the Samagat pool service. Thank you very much for your work. I would like to note the work of the lifeguard Irene, I recommend this hotel to everyone. 121. Comment: Titanic Mardan Palace is an impressive place not only with its sports facilities, but also with its location. Its sea view and luxurious atmosphere are ideal for relaxing and having a good time. The sports academy is excellent, the tennis courts and other ... 122. Yorum: I came here with my family and had a great time. From the food to the hotel rooms and the pools, they were all very nice. The teenager was also very nice, there were so many activities, I had a good time at all of them. There were very nice activities, especially water polo, volleyball and soccer, I am thinking of coming again. 123. Comment: May van a 4. my day at the hotel. We come from Istanbul. We have a great vacation. We choose this hotel every year. The food, entertainment and activities are great. The Mini Club offers many different activities. There is everything from morning gymnastics to evening mini discos and children's programs. We would also like to thank everyone, especially the animators Esra and Sude, for their interest. See you again next year. 124. Comment: The service level of the hotel and the friendliness of its staff can never be disputed! The architecture and atmosphere of the hotel is amazing. The food and drinks are very pleasant. I can say that the energy of the daytime and evening animation team will make your vacation even better. We would like to thank Kaan from the Team for his interest, he was very helpful. See you next year...🙏🏻 125. Comment: Great hotel. The location is amazing, the rooms are extremely nice and clean, daily cleaning and change of towels and bed linen, the staff is incredibly polite. It's worth repeating. Entertainments, pastimes. I highly recommend everyone to experience this joy. 126. Yorum: The hotel was really very nice! We had an amazing stay! The rooms were spacious and really beautifully decorated! The food was very tasty and the selection was also very good! 127. Yorum: All MEN'S SPA MASSAGE THERAPY is very bad - unfortunately. MONEY RELEASE ... They are unskilled and have no work ethic, they are not friendly. I would also like to mention the very helpful and caring work of receptionist Olga. We also loved the breakfast - fantastic selection of food and drinks! Excellent management people - Zarina was an excellent help, she fulfilled many of our requests at a very fast pace! We also enjoyed the live music in the lobby, to be honest, it would be nice to have live music all day - it really lifts the mood. 128. Yorum: The hotel is generally very good. I was particularly pleased with the food and service. The animation team was very successful. Şeymanur was a very energetic and passionate employee. Your communication skills are very good - especially the staff working in such big hotels should have this skill very well. 129. Comment: The Titanic Mardan Palace Hotel is the ideal place for an unforgettable vacation in luxurious conditions on the picturesque sea shore. I would like to share a rave review about their teen club, which impressed me with its diverse entertainment and care for young people. Titanic Mardan Palace Teen Club offers an atmosphere of joy, friendship and fun. My children were delighted with the variety of activities - from beach parties to exciting DJ parties. Professional animators created a pleasant atmosphere and enjoyed working with teenagers, offering interesting master classes and games. I was especially pleased with the staff's attention to the safety of teenagers and their control over what was happening. I was confident that my children were in good hands and that they could enjoy their vacation to the fullest. The Titanic Mardan Palace hotel and their teen club left only the most positive impressions on me. I recommend this place to everyone who wants to spend time comfortably, safely and happily. Thank you for an unforgettable vacation! 130. Comment: Seymanur, one of the hotel's animation team, is completely professional... He does his work with joy and fun. The hotel is very nice, there are many decorative pools.. the food is delicious, there is no problem except that the restaurants are paid.. Thank you Şeymanur, we enjoyed the hotel animation for the first time… 131. Comment: We are returning from a 10-day vacation from the Titanic Mardan Palace. This was a last minute holiday, a family of 4 were looking for a chilled pool holiday and it provided exactly that. We stayed in a deluxe pool view room, it was more than big enough for 2 adults and 8 year old twins, the room was comfortable, nicely decorated and the amazing maid kept it clean before we even got back from breakfast. The food was good quality, we like to take advantage of the A La Carte restaurants, the Italian and Japanese were fabulous and good value for money. We wouldn't visit the Greek restaurant again, the menu was all fish, which we didn't realize before booking and didn't think it was worth the price tag. The steak restaurant, on the other hand, is excellent, its decoration, atmosphere and live music make the extra charge worth it. Husaeyn and his team were fabulous and provided excellent service the several times we ate there. We had no problem with the sunbeds, plenty of choice after breakfast, especially at the cafe end of the pool, the waiters at the pool are brilliant, they looked after us every day and made a real fuss of our children who they loved, Mustafa in particular was excellent. The pool was missing tiles in several places, it didn't affect our stay and I'm sure it's a lot of work to replace them and we'll be doing it over the winter months, but it needs some TLC. This is the first time we have used the kids club, our 8 year old twins loved it, it was enough to keep them occupied when the sun came out in the afternoon, the art and ceramics workshops were amazing. Dileck was amazing with them, I have to mention another member of staff Esra who was a superstar and a real credit to the kids club team, I felt my kids were safe, stimulated and comfortable while we were able to enjoy the rest for the adults. The water park served its purpose, but I feel that on any future trip here, my kids will want bigger slides than the nearby resorts. The gym is well equipped but could open earlier as the early risers were a bit late at 8am. Overall we had a pleasant holiday, the resort was clean, the tables were never left with plates, the staff were efficient, friendly and happy to help with anything you needed. We have visited several other more expensive resorts in Belek and although this hotel is not on their level, it is certainly excellent value for money and worth a visit. 132. Comment: My family and I came to this hotel for the second time! I am happy as always) the rooms are clean, the food is delicious and the selection is wide, the staff is wonderful, they even clean the glasses! I ended up in a teen club where I met the animators and the other guys! It's a lot of fun here, there's an abundant active program, I really like it 😃 We hope and plan to come back here again. 133. Comment: The bartenders on the beach act like relatives, they remember all our preferences from the first order. In general, the rooms and common areas of the hotel were clean. However, a hotel of this quality had many shortcomings. … 134. Comment: We spent 4 nights at the hotel and were generally very satisfied with everything. Food, service, room cleaning was great. However, one problem really bothered us. The toilets in the common areas were not cleaned... The toilet in the hall and where the pool was was very dirty. We loved the hotel but this is the reason we will not choose it again. I hope this problem is fixed soon... This detail is very sad for such a quality hotel. Best regards, 135. Yorum: Wonderful hotel, royal and grand. We stayed in the traditional room which was a bit dark but I would definitely stay in that room again. The facilities for the children are wonderful! 136. Comment: We spent a very pleasant vacation with our family in your hotel. The service, food and drinks are of a very high standard. 137. Comment: Very nice hotel It was a very nice holiday and the service was very good The food was more than good The events are very many and wonderful 🌚 Good choice for a festive meal Finally:- Welcome Professor Sabrina 🌚👋 138. Comment: We can accommodate a family of 4, 2 adults and 2 children. Everyone had something to do. It was amazing service and staff. We were so relaxed we couldn't wait to return. My son who is 4 years old really enjoyed the kids facilities. Would recommend this place to everyone. 139. Comment: Very satisfactory. 10 days of pure relaxation. I would have liked to stay longer. Luxury, pleasure and professional service throughout the hotel. Especially in the SPA area and the beef restaurant. Thank you for everything Titanic Mardan Palace. See you next year :-) 140. Comment: Great hotel with ultra all inclusive! Huge pool and next to the sea. Special thanks to Tini Kids Club, especially Diana in the Art Studio for helping my daughter develop her painting skills! Overall the best experience, excellent cocktails and evening shows. Ah yes, the room cleaning and the very friendly staff also made our vacation fabulous! 141. Yorum: We arrived at this hotel on May 13th, and when I sat down on the sofa near the reception, I felt like I had fallen into such soft sofas. The chairs are very strong. The restaurant has very delicious food, especially "Stella snack" and "Mardan bistro" very nice rooms and villas, and most of the hotel is water, the spa has many pools, it is very cool and warm. water bars have many different Doritos drinks and salty chips. Two soccer fields, a tennis court and a volleyball court, there are many places for different age groups, for example, for children 4-10 years old "Teen club" for children 11-16 years old "Teenage club" for over 18 years old "Mykonos club" many activities for everyone. I want to write about the "Teenage club" very nice and cool game machines, table football, two billiards, many board games, two Playstation 5 with discs and a bar I also wanted to say about the staff that they are very nice and smiling and always help, thank you Alina Zarina and Rana, and there is also a soccer coach, Charlie, and he looks a lot like Cristiano Ronaldo 142. Comment: I can say that it was a wonderful week at mardan palace, everything was so good, the food was so delicious and the staff was so friendly and hospitable even for Iranian visitors. I strongly recommend that you follow … 143. Comment: I really liked the hotel. Pros: Location Nice sandy beach Quality and variety of food Sensitive staff The hotel is suitable for a quiet family holiday with children, there is a mini club which is so nice that we really like it. Special thanks to the beautiful mini club animators Yasemin and Ayşenur thank you. 144. Yorum: Excellent hotel, everything at the highest level, cuisine, animation, games: volleyball, football... Coach Sheyma, always positive. We came to play volleyball on the third day, we really liked it. The coach is simply great (Sheima). We regretted not coming earlier. Everything is at the highest level... absolutely 145. Comment: It was the best holiday of my life! My family had the best time during their stay in August 2024, everything we could have wanted for a perfect vacation. Plenty of programs for adults, water polo, aqua spinning, trampoline jumping in the pool, darts. In the children's club, fantastic rocket making, face painting, perfume making, car painting! My daughter loved the cinema and arcades, although it would be worth getting a couple more as they can be busy at times. The pool party was like being in Ibiza, it was fantastic 👌 The evening shows are fun. Our waiter Erzhan was fantastic, always checking to see if we needed another drink. Mykonos bar was a lot of fun after the show bartender Tougut (hope that's spelled correctly) was very happy to see us and took some great shots! The swim up pool bar was my favorite, the super bar man made the best cocktails! The food was on another level, only a slight criticism can mix it up in the buffet, our waiter Akim was very attentive, he knew where we like to sit and what drinks we like. The beef restaurant was the best steak for me and my husband! Our waiter, Omer, was so nice and attentive. Try the crispy onion appetizer! The Stella snack restaurant was delicious, the staff again very friendly. We booked a cabana on the beach for three days, it was very relaxing and it was great to have a nice shaded area for my daughter. Great service. We had a family room which was perfect for the three of us, very elegantly decorated. Lots of Molton brown products. A big thank you to our amazing maid Baehan who works so hard, kept our room tidy and clean and even helped with the air conditioning. This hotel has everything you need for a pleasant holiday, both adults and children will find something fun to do. The staff here really make this place paradise. I hope to visit again next year and maybe bring more family. 146. Comment: I spend a few days at Titanic Mardan Palace and overall it was a delightful experience. The food has been consistently delicious and offers a variety of options that cater to different tastes. Be it breakfast, lunch or dinner, the quality and presentation of the food was impressive. The pool and beach are well maintained and provide a perfect environment for relaxation. The pool is clean with plenty of sunbeds and the beach is only a short walk away with stunning views and crystal clear water. One of the highlights of my stay was the animation service. The team organizes a range of activities, including volleyball, darts and water polo, which are great fun and a great opportunity to meet other guests. I would like to give a special shout out to Seymanur who did a fantastic job organizing these activities. His energy and enthusiasm made every event enjoyable and engaging. The evening dance shows are also enjoyable and make the nights spent here more lively. Overall, my time at Titanic Mardan Palace was enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a well-rounded vacation experience with plenty of activities and relaxation. 147.
