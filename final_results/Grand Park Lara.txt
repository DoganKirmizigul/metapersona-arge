But all this is spoiled by the quality of service, very cold and unprofessional welcome for a 4 star hotel, room not clean on arrival, request for an iron (normal for a 4 star) we are told that it does not exist at their place and that we had to pay for the dry cleaning when a cleaning lady brought us one, a real disgrace!!!!!!

We had so much fun on the water slides and different pools that are here. Yorum: The hotel is quite nice, 2 large swimming pools and one with slides for children. Too bad about the balcony, which we didn't have, but hey, we had a room at the front with a view of the pool. For the deckchairs in front of the pool, you have to wake up very early! Several swimming pools. Several swimming pools, well-secured park. The second small point is the shops because many things are chargeable in the hotel but this is understandable because this is an additional request but in the evening when the parties take place there is a man holding a game where the children enter balls which float on the pool, a funny game and which we thought was included in the all in. Yorum: Very good stay, with a large choice of buffet, swimming pools. Yorum: We had a good holiday but there are a few things that could be improved: - the standard room is very small, plus we didn't have a cot (even though I had specified it) and it was two single beds pushed together - the cleaning is sloppy, the bathroom is not very clean, lack of storage - some members of staff are not very welcoming, they only want your money or talk to you out of self-interest - the hotel is far from the city centre but it is complete: spa, restaurant, activities for children, swimming pool and beach, it is rather appreciable. and you can't take food by the pool.

Yorum: 2 beautiful swimming pools plus the 3rd with slides (great for children); the food is good and varied, the kid club entertainers are great. A horrible noise and let's not talk about the swimming pools we are like sardines on top of each other. Yorum: I am currently at the hotel for the price not too bad what is a shame is that in the evening it is difficult to find a place at the table to have a drink because there are a lot of people, the beach is more or less 400 m there is a hotel shuttle that will take us, the food is correct and I have a room with a terrace on the other hand for those who want to sleep peacefully a little complicated because there is a lot of noise in the evening, last small detail those who want a place by the pool must get up early 43. Swimming pool and gym, bar, everything is there... It is difficult to find 1 deckchair by the pool. I went as a couple for 6 nights (early October), we really liked it, large buffet, impeccable service, beautiful swimming pool, etc...

Large swimming pool with slides. I am Addition, there is a horrible sewage smell outside near the pools which is really off putting and not pleasant to smell. There is a gym and several swimming pools. The staff was very well organized, the pool is very clean. We had clean pool and beach towels every day, and the beach ‚õ± has no rocks, the entry into the sea is gentle. We went to the pool and everything was already full, there was no place to sit, lots of beds, towels but no one on them. The next morning at 7am I went to get a cup of coffee and to my surprise all the pool beds were full of towels, there were only a few beds available so if you wanted to lie down you had to get a sunbed early, ridiculous as most people only came to bed in the afternoon. Too little space by the pool, crowded and the evening meal was always the same. To find a deckchair by the pool, you have to wake up at 7am and take a deckchair. The pool is very busy and sometimes it is impossible to find a place to swim comfortably. The area around the pool was dirty, we didn't see any staff coming to help if something was spilled on the floor or there was litter. Of particular note are the swimming pools, which are beautiful and well maintained. The deckchair situation only really occurs at the main pool. We had so much fun on the water slides and different pools that are here. +Good 24/7 food and beverage facilities +The swimming pools are divided into three: swimming pool, children's pool and Aqua. +The variety of each meal is quite good, but unfortunately it did not appeal to us in terms of taste What we are not satisfied with: -pollution of the pools, while we were among the first to enter the pool in the morning, sharp stones that settled on the bottom hurt our feet throughout the holiday, cleaning of the bottom of the pool is poor -Unfortunately, the area around the pool is dirty, largely due to the negligence and disorder of the guests, but given this situation, everything should be swept at least in the evening. Even though we were alone in the pool for two hours, the number of sunbeds we had was one, as the others were "reserved" with items such as towels. and pool bagels. and slow for those on the 9th floor -I find it a shame that people are allowed to leave their personal towels and children's pool toys out at the end of the day. It was very nice not to have to worry about cleaning the pool and sun loungers. Fresh water is available throughout the hotel. Not at all, the man took two of my children up, sent them out into the water and then told me it cost 10 euros. moreover bus of the bathroom area water leak flowing .... Yorum: A very large complex Too many people in August Staff not very friendly Complex on 3 blocks Our block suffered damage very big water leak the facts were in August 2018 Bad publicity for a complex classified 4 stars. To visit during the stay in Antalya the waterfalls and the sea trip Magnificent landscape. There were water cuts and maintenance problems; near the elevator and in the hotel bar! There were water cuts and maintenance problems near the elevator and the hotel bar! The room has a fridge, water, kettle, tea and coffee, air conditioning. Cold bottled water is always available and there are refrigerators with water. Among the disadvantages I would say the water pressure in the rooms. Huge hotel area, beautiful and large beach, smooth entry into the water, attention to detail, customer care. One evening we had heavy rain and thunder, rain water got into the floor of the hotel room, soaked, also in our son and daughter-in-law's room, so we dried everything ourselves, so we couldn't use the elevator. when people were taking a shower we heard it upstairs the water was running down the drains the food was not always hot and the fruit was sometimes too hard The entertainment team did not involve people enough in the activities The evening shows have been pretty much the same for 3 years, after the shows last year nothing to do DJ in the bar now Seen once In other hotels much more atmosphere and music However, it left me with great people, a great holiday and wonderful memories. The rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels and bottled water in the fridge. We had so much fun on the water slides and different pools that are here.

Yorum: I recently stayed at this hotel with my family and it was a disaster from start to finish. The room (Family Suite) was large, very clean, it was cleaned daily. Adults 5 people, rented 2 rooms, family and standard Excellent and varied cuisine, special thanks to the pastry chef, cleanliness, polite staff, very hardworking. The lady at reception reserved a family room with balcony for us even though we had taken a standard room. My family all enjoyed the food, there is something for everyone. Yorum: We stayed in 3 rooms for a family of 9 between August 23rd and 30th. Several activities: cinema, kids clubs. A slightly more annoying problem that I did not understand during the stay is that no child under 16 can participate in the simple program without counting the kids club. Because it is separated between the adult schedule which should not be and the kids club. The first time it was very nice when me and my husband went there with the kids, then we left because we didn't have the money on us with my husband looking for the money upstairs in the room. They didn't even have simple options for kids like pizza etc. The main pearl of the hotel is the kids club. I would like to thank the kids club team: Mariana, Sulfiye, Angelina, Sude and Altynay. The kids club was very successful. Several activities: cinema, kids clubs.

Not at all, the man took two of my children up, sent them out into the water and then told me it cost 10 euros. Our children stayed there to see their favourite and were kicked out the second we left as obviously children can't pay for anything and they understood very well that there was nothing to be gained with children alone. |The children loved the festive and friendly atmosphere.|I recommend it. |The children loved the festive and friendly atmosphere.|I recommend it.

The hotel has a children's playground, a games room and a cinema. At the end of each day, this club organizes a mini disco for all the children. They are a true example of how to spend time with children. Children come to this club with great enthusiasm, which is good for parents, who can relax and not worry about their child. There are plenty of things for children to do. Special thanks to the children's club "Miniclub". Our children had a lot of fun there and were excited about the activities and care. Yorum: We rested on August 19 for 11 days with my husband and two children (10 years old and 1 year old). Yorum: My children and I are having a wonderful time. +Good 24/7 food and beverage facilities +The swimming pools are divided into three: swimming pool, children's pool and Aqua. and slow for those on the 9th floor -I find it a shame that people are allowed to leave their personal towels and children's pool toys out at the end of the day. Our 3 children spent the whole day there without ever getting bored. The play sisters and brothers were caring, kind and attentive to the children, we would especially like to thank our sister H√©lin :) The cleaning of the rooms was very good, but the mini-bar and water renewal services were not sufficient.

Yorum: We had a good holiday but there are a few things that could be improved: - the standard room is very small, plus we didn't have a cot (even though I had specified it) and it was two single beds pushed together - the cleaning is sloppy, the bathroom is not very clean, lack of storage - some members of staff are not very welcoming, they only want your money or talk to you out of self-interest - the hotel is far from the city centre but it is complete: spa, restaurant, activities for children, swimming pool and beach, it is rather appreciable. Yorum: Room too small and without terrace because we had a child Very nice staff and clean hotel with enough deckchairs 17. Cleanliness and warm welcome.. The whole hotel was very clean. But all this is spoiled by the quality of service, very cold and unprofessional welcome for a 4 star hotel, room not clean on arrival, request for an iron (normal for a 4 star) we are told that it does not exist at their place and that we had to pay for the dry cleaning when a cleaning lady brought us one, a real disgrace!!!!!!

Yorum: Nice clean hotel 100. The room, although small, is comfortable, clean and well cleaned. The beach is clean, there is a playground, a bar and toilets. The staff were incredibly rude, including the cleaning staff, who showed no respect for our privacy. The room cleaning is a bit poor. The entire hotel is constantly cleaned. While the staff cleans very quickly and efficiently, this does not mean that you can leave the waste anywhere. The room (Family Suite) was large, very clean, it was cleaned daily. The staff was very well organized, the pool is very clean. We had clean pool and beach towels every day, and the beach ‚õ± has no rocks, the entry into the sea is gentle. Adults 5 people, rented 2 rooms, family and standard Excellent and varied cuisine, special thanks to the pastry chef, cleanliness, polite staff, very hardworking. The staff are friendly and do their best despite the heat to keep everything clean and tidy. The room was clean, cleaning is done upon request. It is constantly open, but it cannot be said to be very clean. The rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels and bottled water in the fridge. The rooms were poorly cleaned and a towel was often forgotten. +The room cleaning is good +The breakfast is good +The entertainment is good +In case of emergency, thanks to the location of the hotel, it is good to be able to meet your needs from places like pharmacies and markets. +The variety of each meal is quite good, but unfortunately it did not appeal to us in terms of taste What we are not satisfied with: -pollution of the pools, while we were among the first to enter the pool in the morning, sharp stones that settled on the bottom hurt our feet throughout the holiday, cleaning of the bottom of the pool is poor -Unfortunately, the area around the pool is dirty, largely due to the negligence and disorder of the guests, but given this situation, everything should be swept at least in the evening. This negatively affects or even prevents cleaning. The loungers are very heavy and cannot be retrieved and rearranged every day, but in a very large and crowded hotel, cleanliness is very important at the meeting point of everyone. It was very nice not to have to worry about cleaning the pool and sun loungers. The play sisters and brothers were caring, kind and attentive to the children, we would especially like to thank our sister H√©lin :) The cleaning of the rooms was very good, but the mini-bar and water renewal services were not sufficient.

Last advice if you take a taxi ask the price before and especially ask them to write it down!!!

We had a wonderful and safe holiday in a vast area, without having to worry about eating and drinking 24 hours a day. Even with a not very long schedule, certain activities such as beach volleyball are still completely neglected (there is no facilitator there even if it is marked as an activity) which makes it more complicated to find a place in the game in view of the mix of languages. The second small point is the shops because many things are chargeable in the hotel but this is understandable because this is an additional request but in the evening when the parties take place there is a man holding a game where the children enter balls which float on the pool, a funny game and which we thought was included in the all in.

Not at all, the man took two of my children up, sent them out into the water and then told me it cost 10 euros. Our children stayed there to see their favourite and were kicked out the second we left as obviously children can't pay for anything and they understood very well that there was nothing to be gained with children alone. |The children loved the festive and friendly atmosphere.|I recommend it. |The children loved the festive and friendly atmosphere.|I recommend it.

All results text for Night Entertainment Program: Evening shows by professionals. when people were taking a shower we heard it upstairs the water was running down the drains the food was not always hot and the fruit was sometimes too hard The entertainment team did not involve people enough in the activities The evening shows have been pretty much the same for 3 years, after the shows last year nothing to do DJ in the bar now Seen once In other hotels much more atmosphere and music However, it left me with great people, a great holiday and wonderful memories. Dancing, DJ, songs, magic tricks.
