The hotel staff, all kinds of services, food and drinks, everything is great, the only problem is that the repertoire of songs has been the same for years, they are quite old, there is no innovation, they sing it to those who want a piece, it is so funny that there is not even a plum branch, we heard this at the Pier party tonight listening from afar 😂 Instead of showing useless entertainment, I wish those who are interested in the organization of the evening would add current foreign Turkish music.

The pool and beach are very clean and it feels like something is always being cleaned somewhere. We couldn't go to the pool, but we were lucky to find some sun loungers on the beach. Excellent beach, when the hotel is full there are always empty sunbeds on the beach and by the pool. Beach and rooms good. The beach is small, about 50 meters wide and the nearly 150 sun loungers are so close together that it is impossible to have any privacy. The beach and pools are very beautiful and suitable for families.

The swimming pool is right next to the hotel and there are stairs leading directly to the beach. Swimming: The loungers at the pool sell out pretty quickly, but there's always plenty of room on the beach! The beach is exclusively a sandy beach and to no longer be able to stand in the water, you only have to take a few steps! There is another snack bar on the beach where you can eat typical dishes such as hamburgers with fries, chicken with rice, kofta, spaghetti, etc. It's just a shame that the beach snack bar is unfortunately only open until 4pm. Short distances to the pier and beach. Bottled water is available on the beach, the many bars have plenty of choice, of course these cocktails are pure sugar like in all all inclusive hotels but who forces you to drink that so to all the 1 star reviewers, you almost ruined the best holiday I had last time. Also, the snack bar near the beach was very successful, the table service and the service.

The beach is excellent, go to the sea and sand. Anyone who thinks the beach is too small, which is also true, can take the bus for little money that leaves every half hour and go to Cleopatra beach, which is huge and absolutely beautiful and worth a visit. The beach was also definitely our favourite - the sand is superb and clean. Very nice sandy beach right next to the hotel and always enough sun loungers on the beach and at the pool.

The pool is clean, the sea is wavy but it has sand and a nice warm sea. , we couldn't sleep, the hallways smelled of cigarette smoke, they ate and drank in the sea and polluted it, we couldn't swim, I don't even want to talk about the pool, people had cleaned their bathrooms, people were literally throwing up, it was horrible, the staff was very patient and well-mannered, I felt really sorry for them, I would like to thank the favorite lady in the lobby for her attention, I would like to thank Mr. Yorum: The hotel is very nice, clean and the sea is warm, but at every meal we politely asked "Can we have a spoon?" "Can we have 1 plate?" When we say, there are two employees who say to go here to get it instead of bringing it. The only thing in season is that there are no strawberries or seafood at all. Anyone with a sea view in front will be tormented until midnight. Yorum: In my opinion, the sea makes up for the hotel's shortcomings. The sea is really beautiful, clean, without waves. Yorum: The hotel service, food, staff, cleanliness, sea are very pleasant and satisfactory, the activities and entertainment are also very good, and it is a hotel that can be preferred again and again, where my wife and I stayed for the second time between 07-11 June 2024.

However, there were red spots on the toilet seat that were already burnt. see photo and on the other balcony with sea view there were even 3. I have been to Turkey 3 times before by the sea in 5 star hotels and I can say that this hotel overall was the best so far! Very well located, right by the sea. The sea water is crystal clear and suitable for snorkeling. swimming pool very close to the sea 5. We are currently at the hotel and we cannot use the pool much because the sea is cold, but I clearly say that I will definitely return during the season. The rooms with sea view are magnificent by the way 127. Sea view as booked. We were worried when we arrived, we weren't going during the season, wondering if there would be any disruption. Yorum: At all times Excellent service and very helpful and professional staff The resort is small but nice and the pier by the sea is beautiful The beach is also good 161. The one towel per day policy is really stupid, you use your one towel everywhere, at the sea, sauna, swimming pool, etc. Positive: No pushy salespeople No loud music, spacious area, enough sun loungers and seating, clean, large pier Beach could be wider, staff a bit friendlier Rooms facing the main street are quite noisy 173. It can be said that there is a luxury shopping center within the hotel, a complete living space from the gym to the spa center, the sea is very clean, the beach sand is good. Well, the beach is a bit small, but the facilities they built in the sea more than make up for that difference. I can't tell you the pleasure of looking at the sea and the view every day while enjoying the jacuzzi on this large balcony. The sea was perfect and clean. We had some disagreements regarding the hotel's policy regarding rooms with direct sea views, but we finally reached a common denominator!

Yorum: We really liked the hotel, we arrived at the end of March, we even went shopping at sea, the water park started operating on April 1st, the service was great, everyone was very nice and welcoming. The food is delicious, even if you get to the end you won't leave hungry (Monday is seafood day) The grounds and rooms are well cleaned Cons: No toothpaste included, not enough entertainment program It would be great if there was a volleyball net or basketball court 183. The food is standard, unpretentious, but tasty and there is little fruit, only simple seafood fish. The beach is excellent, go to the sea and sand. The sea is clean. But it is always possible to take a more expensive room with a sea view. It was nice to swim, the sunbathing area and bar built on the sea was very pleasant. We also bought a sea view room, but we only got a small sea view, more of a side view. There is a huge clean swimming pool outside and a lovely jetty with a bar and steps down to the sea for swimming. We were on the 5th floor with a sea view. The sea is right next to the hotel, with its own beach. The sea was more beautiful than I expected. When you swim in the sea in the early morning, the clarity of the water is very beautiful. Waking up with a sea view is also very pleasant. This is why I recommend a room with a sea view or side sea view. The weather was good to us, we even went swimming in the sea and sunbathing. The hotel is located on the seafront and has a Blue Flag sandy beach. The sea is really beautiful, clean, without waves.

Yorum: In general, it is a nice hotel right by the sea, there is a children's pool and an adult pool, mainly German and Russian guests. The children have a lot of fun in the swimming pool. We would expect the same kindness and service from the bartenders around the pool. There is plenty of entertainment for children, the sea, the beach, the swimming pools, the shops, everything is great. What I can say negatively is that the hotel campus is narrow and the swimming pools are insufficient. The pool and beach are very clean and it feels like something is always being cleaned somewhere. We couldn't go to the pool, but we were lucky to find some sun loungers on the beach. Smoking, drinking and eating in the pool is a daily order for them, and shouting in the rooms and hallways is also normal for them. The music playing from boomboxes by the pool can drive you crazy after a few days. Excellent beach, when the hotel is full there are always empty sunbeds on the beach and by the pool. The pool is clean, the sea is wavy but it has sand and a nice warm sea. Even by the pool, everyone plays music with their own sound cannon. There is a nice pier, the swimming pool doesn't look bad either and the service is also a positive aspect.

The photographer arrives at the children's pool with a parrot in his hand. High level service, both in the lobby, in the restaurant and by the pool. Although the beach is a bit small, we had no trouble finding a spot at the Havux and the poolside activities are very enjoyable. Tatyana from guest relations helped us a lot from the day we arrived at the hotel, we thank her, she solved our plane problems immediately, every hotel should have employees who know their job, in general, I recommend it, also the pool and the beach Very clean, we did not lack sunbeds even though. The facilities and pools were very clean. The only downside is that the pool floor is very slippery. There is a bird's nest in the corner of the balcony, but it is in every room, which I was able to observe from the pool. And their droppings are everywhere else (including in the pool). The swimming pool is right next to the hotel and there are stairs leading directly to the beach.

Snacks: The pool bar serves cocktails and alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks until 6 p.m. swimming pool very close to the sea 5. We are currently at the hotel and we cannot use the pool much because the sea is cold, but I clearly say that I will definitely return during the season.

The rooms and their furniture are new, the food is varied and delicious, the swimming pools are sufficient, the night entertainment is successful... Yorum: A luxurious hotel, very friendly and knowledgeable staff, beautiful air-conditioned rooms, very nice pool area, highly recommended. The indoor pool is still closed 4. The one towel per day policy is really stupid, you use your one towel everywhere, at the sea, sauna, swimming pool, etc. Even when the pool operating time is specified, they close it an hour early, for no reason. The hotel, rooms, pool were very clean. Only the pool bar staff were always friendly, helpful and sometimes had a funny saying, greeting etc. There are games and activities in the pool every day. single man fighting by the pool and not taking care of the kids... The pools are clean but very cold and so is the indoor spa. We were interested in heating at least in the children's room, but the answer killed us - it turns out that the hotel operates according to the summer concept and the heating of the pools has already been turned off. The only downside was the loud noise from the pool all day. I didn't go swimming in the pool, but the water was very warm to the touch, based on this I assume they are heated pools, which I have never encountered before when I was in Turkey. Very nice sandy beach right next to the hotel and always enough sun loungers on the beach and at the pool. There is a huge clean swimming pool outside and a lovely jetty with a bar and steps down to the sea for swimming. The swimming pools are also sufficient. Everything is so minimal Pool too small Beach too small The deck chairs I saw in the pictures aren't even there!!! It is advisable to wear non-slip shoes in the pool, otherwise you will slip very quickly. The swimming pools are sufficient. Alcohol is unlimited by the glass only, so most of what you drink is water. We ask the restaurant waiters for tea or water, but they bring it to us very late. The rooms are clean, they are cleaned regularly every day, the minibar is constantly replenished with free soda and water, the meals are varied and sufficient, you can always eat something. You really don't want to go on windy days because a lot of plastic builds up and there's a disgusting film on the water. Drinks come out of the tap with smelly water, which can of course be crushed with a lemon. Yorum: We experienced power and water outages during our 4 day vacation.

The beach is exclusively a sandy beach and to no longer be able to stand in the water, you only have to take a few steps! Right next door you can take small bottles of water out of the fridge at any time. Fruits are always provided: watermelons, sweet melons, bananas and apples. The sea water is crystal clear and suitable for snorkeling. Bottled water is available on the beach, the many bars have plenty of choice, of course these cocktails are pure sugar like in all all inclusive hotels but who forces you to drink that so to all the 1 star reviewers, you almost ruined the best holiday I had last time. Yorum: It was very nice here, I especially enjoyed the volleyball, thanks to Diana the sports teacher for the good entertainment, the shows were also very special, something new every day, the food was very tasty, darts, water jimnastics and so on 🤌🤌 🤌 … 156.

Ulaşım İmkanları için tüm sonuçlar metni: The transport is excellent, it takes 30 minutes to Alanya. This means that you don't need to take a taxi to a big city for shopping, but you can get to a big city for shopping in 2 minutes. The driver kept falling asleep during the ride, which was getting so dangerous that we eventually had to get off and take a taxi. Otherwise you pay around €30 for a taxi ride from the hotel to the city. We don't know it at the hotel, at the airport or on the plane, but from the first day home, everyone got sick. The hotel is also a little further from the airport. Some German teenagers brought Jägermeister and Redbull with them from the airport. Yorum: Return Trip from May 18 to May 25, 2024 Positive: Very clean rooms, very clean facilities Attentive staff, always doing their best, always very helpful Very clean beach, good quality water Food was good, maybe too much stew, would have liked more vegetable platters Cocktail quality could have been better, but ok Entertainment at parties was very good, great team at departure who encouraged people to party Negative: Layover from airport to hotel and also on return at a scam tourist stop, Latvian chips for 4 euros, freshly squeezed orange juice 0.3 for 9 euros Room was too noisy for me (I have tinnitus, I have hearing loss at night), I couldn't sleep with the window open. 2 hours drive from the airport, a bit long, but the atmosphere makes up for it!!! Yorum: A bit far from the airport (2 hours), but right on the beach. Yorum: Quite a long drive from Antalya airport, about 1 hour 45 minutes but great. We arrived from the airport at 1:30 p.m. The journey from Antalya airport to the hotel took about 2 hours. Do not allow parrots into the business. Tip: There is a bus station directly on the expressway from the hotel. The bus makes 3.4 stops to the city center, which is about half an hour. The bus runs every 10 minutes during the day and every 30 minutes at nightfall. The bus service runs until 11:30 p.m. Yorum: A little busy for me, but otherwise the food, drinks, accommodation and staff are great. Very close to bus stops and there was a big city across the street. We had to sleep with the window open, which wasn't very noisy either, there was a busy highway nearby. Those looking for more peace and quiet should look for another hotel, a little outside of town, as this hotel is located directly on a busy road. Anyone who thinks the beach is too small, which is also true, can take the bus for little money that leaves every half hour and go to Cleopatra beach, which is huge and absolutely beautiful and worth a visit. It's also nice that the beach is on the hotel grounds, saving you from having to cross a busy street. Nearby there is a federal highway and a bus stop. The lobby was nice in itself but felt like a train station as people/large groups of young people were sitting there with jukeboxes. At the hotel, this nuance was not taken into account, there were no shows or animation programs yet and we had to organize our leisure ourselves, fortunately there are car rentals and beautiful views of the entire coast of Antalya. Let me clarify that you will have no problem parking when entering the hotel. For parking and reservation check-in procedures, they drop off your luggage at the reception. Yorum: Good location Nice beach, nice pool Nice design Everything is correct BUT when I ask the waiter for a cocktail he gives me milk mixed with a tiny bit of pineapple juice (for the pina colada) so when you drink it you feel like you're drinking milk... Yorum: Very good location of the hotel. The food is very bad, it's always the same, only the location of the dishes changes. The hotel was very nice, but we were worried about the location.

Yorum: Actually, it's a very nice hotel and a great location. Yorum: A superb location, quality service, very helpful 5 star cuisine.

Yorum: The location and rooms were very clean and nice. Yorum: The location of the hotel was very good. The location of the hotel is very nice, the beach is small but sufficient. The location of the hotel is also good, as you are directly in Avsallar with shops/restaurants either via an underpass or a bridge. The location of the hotel is very convenient.

We had to sleep with the window open, which wasn't very noisy either, there was a busy highway nearby. The main street of the village is nearby, I even find it difficult to call it a village, because it is quite beautiful and modern, more like a small town. Nearby there is a federal highway and a bus stop. If you go there for very little money, ok, but otherwise there are 10,000 hotels in the surrounding area that are better. I have been to this area near Alanya 7 times and I really regret being fooled by azura. The swimming area is very small. There is a large shopping area opposite the hotel. Visibly dirty areas such as the mirror and chrome fittings in the bathroom were particularly disturbing. The general condition of the hotel was appalling: obvious contamination was visible in all areas. Yorum: The location is nice, the shopping area right next door. There is a spa area in the hotel where you can also book massages. Yorum: A luxurious hotel, very friendly and knowledgeable staff, beautiful air-conditioned rooms, very nice pool area, highly recommended. Yorum: +service, food, atmosphere - everything is at the highest level - there is not enough greenery on the territory of the hotel🌴 +the rooms are modern, clean and comfortable -I was not very impressed with the daily cleaning 3/5 Overall, we liked the hotel, it is very luxurious, but the area is not big at all and this is the main drawback. Positive: No pushy salespeople No loud music, spacious area, enough sun loungers and seating, clean, large pier Beach could be wider, staff a bit friendlier Rooms facing the main street are quite noisy 173. The hotel area is small, but for us it was an advantage. It was nice to swim, the sunbathing area and bar built on the sea was very pleasant. The beach area is unfortunately a bit small, but a lot has been accomplished with the options available, it's great. Everywhere, including common areas, cleanliness is impeccable.

Year: Very nice hotel Lacks a bit of greenery Correct meals and drinks Super nice and helpful staff I recommend this place dymps 17.

We are about 23 and 27 years old, we have vacationed in many places, including many times… 22. The employees are very friendly and attentive, we never felt out of place. We had to leave the hotel and head towards the activities that would take place. This is by no means a place for a family vacation. The level has fallen in places. I have stayed in many hotels, but this place is so different. Our conclusion about this hotel: If you are looking for a party and loud music, this is the place for you! If you just want to party all day, you've come to the right place! Yorum: Very nice and clean hotel, the food was very good, the service was also excellent, there are no flaws, I would recommend it to everyone if a restaurant is closed there is another place to eat, so the … 91.

It all started on the first day we arrived, when they didn't have any rooms available and we were placed in a family room. Then I trotted up to the room alone and first disappointment: the room overlooks the street and that is unreasonable for a family with small children. It is definitely a family hotel, but you can find entertainment for adults and children. It was a complete family hotel. Yorum: We were there as a family from 03/09 to 13/09/2024. Yorum: We came in July and stayed with family for the first time. This is by no means a place for a family vacation. Anyone with family should not come. This is anything but a family hotel. It may have once been a family hotel. If you just want a relaxing family or general vacation, everyone who still has the opportunity should cancel their vacation and book another hotel. But it is a reasonable hotel where you can come with family. Don't look for flavor in food The biggest problem is not a family hotel The majority of people staying are single and Syrian nationals. This is not a hotel where you can go with your family. Yorum: This is our first time here as a family, I don't have a word to say.

The hotel was supposed to be a family hotel, it was more of a simple hotel. Yorum: We stayed at the hotel as a family with a 4 year old child and it was a wonderful 10 days. Yorum: We arrived as a family of four, received a very friendly welcome, thank you again and had a great holiday. The mini disco for the kids in the evening was great fun. The staff that works at the pool don't care at all if the kids bring plates full of food to the pool and eat it there and half of it flies around the pool, same goes for drinks and no one cares. I would like to highlight a few things in particular; The kids club and its team were very successful, it was the best I have ever seen, my 7 year old daughter always participated with pleasure. single man fighting by the pool and not taking care of the kids... people touching and grabbing your kids like it's a puppy - I've never seen that in my life!!! There is a kids club, but it's kind of quiet. This would be great for a group of over 30s without kids. I would like to highlight a few things in particular; The kids club and its team were very successful, it was the best I have ever seen, my 7 year old daughter always participated with pleasure. There is a kids club, but it's kind of quiet. The entertainment leaves something to be desired, they don't put an ice cube in to take care of the children. We were a group of 18 people (10 adults, 2 teenagers and 6 children). Then I trotted up to the room alone and first disappointment: the room overlooks the street and that is unreasonable for a family with small children. Yorum: In general, it is a nice hotel right by the sea, there is a children's pool and an adult pool, mainly German and Russian guests. It is definitely a family hotel, but you can find entertainment for adults and children. The children have a lot of fun in the swimming pool. Except the show reserved for children!!!! There is plenty of entertainment for children, the sea, the beach, the swimming pools, the shops, everything is great. There are many activities for children. First of all, families with children should not consider this hotel. In summary, the resort is nice, but less suitable for families with children due to the high proportion of young people who do not always behave appropriately. Yorum: We came to the hotel yesterday with my 2 children. Yorum: We stayed with my wife and 2 children for 4 nights and 5 days. My conclusion about this hotel is not for families with children or couples over 40 looking for peace and relaxation. Families or couples with or without children looking for peace and relaxation on holiday are not in good hands here. There are different sections for children and adults. Also, it was not very good that the children's animation group asked them to give positive comments after each program.

He grills the fish, cooks the chicken on it, and the fish smells, it's not raw, hit it quickly, it's done late, I absolutely do not recommend it, the animation is always aimed at foreigners and their children, they are constantly making announcements in foreign languages, as I said, your night speaks to you either in German or in English, I say I'm Turkish, you are there. The entertainment for the children was great... There are children or adults who cannot eat spicy foods. Very open-minded, especially towards children. I immediately noticed that he was flirting badly with a woman who was traveling alone with her children. The entertainment team is very interested in children. Lots of activities for adults and children. Very nice for children. If you bought vouchers and after the purchase you are looking for new reviews or photos that I missed so much, then I will tell you: you made the right choice by choosing Azurochka 👍 The animation is good, in the evening the animation works for children and a little later for adults. At the amphitheater, every day, a show is first organized for the children, and then the real show begins. We were interested in heating at least in the children's room, but the answer killed us - it turns out that the hotel operates according to the summer concept and the heating of the pools has already been turned off. There is no children's playground. This time we had our grandchildren with us. In addition, young children also slide down these slides and some minor accidents have occurred because the relevant staff did not pay enough attention to them.

Yorum: We came in July and stayed with family for the first time. This is by no means a place for a family vacation. Anyone with family should not come. This is anything but a family hotel. It may have once been a family hotel. If you just want a relaxing family or general vacation, everyone who still has the opportunity should cancel their vacation and book another hotel. But it is a reasonable hotel where you can come with family. Don't look for flavor in food The biggest problem is not a family hotel The majority of people staying are single and Syrian nationals.

I recommend it without reservation, it's a place I will return to again and again, thank you Azura Deluxe family 🙏🙏🙏🙏 159. The food and souvenir shop is tragic, we bought some Turkish delights there and there were worms and flies inside, it was meant to be a souvenir for the family and the embarrassment I felt after opening them was unbelievable. Yorum: We had a great family vacation. Yorum: We really enjoyed it as a family, there were 5 of us, the food and the sea and lots of sunbeds, there is a bazaar and lots of shops and a mosque nearby🕌 I recommend it👍👍👍👍 181.

Parti Deneyimi için tüm sonuçlar metni: We have already changed rooms once because the party continued several times in our neighboring room at 4am, probably after the disco had finished. If you want to party in a group of young people, then this hotel is probably pretty good. In addition, it was often very noisy at night because many young people were partying in the hotel, which significantly disrupted our desire for a relaxing holiday. We had an unforgettable party on the pier the second night here. In order to hear some music, we lay down on the end of the deckchairs to watch the party at the neighboring Granada Hotel, that says it all. This is a hotel for young people who want to party from morning until late at night. Moreover, almost 30% of the guests are young Russians and just come to party. Our conclusion about this hotel: If you are looking for a party and loud music, this is the place for you! If you just want to party all day, you've come to the right place! The atmosphere of the hotel is more like that of the 60s, there is no party atmosphere. This is about the party on the pier. Yorum: The hotel is ok, aimed more at young people who want to party and not at families with children. This is not a family hotel, lots of groups of young men partying there 24/7! The hotel staff, all kinds of services, food and drinks, everything is great, the only problem is that the repertoire of songs has been the same for years, they are quite old, there is no innovation, they sing it to those who want a piece, it is so funny that there is not even a plum branch, we heard this at the Pier party tonight listening from afar 😂 Instead of showing useless entertainment, I wish those who are interested in the organization of the evening would add current foreign Turkish music. Yorum: Return Trip from May 18 to May 25, 2024 Positive: Very clean rooms, very clean facilities Attentive staff, always doing their best, always very helpful Very clean beach, good quality water Food was good, maybe too much stew, would have liked more vegetable platters Cocktail quality could have been better, but ok Entertainment at parties was very good, great team at departure who encouraged people to party Negative: Layover from airport to hotel and also on return at a scam tourist stop, Latvian chips for 4 euros, freshly squeezed orange juice 0.3 for 9 euros Room was too noisy for me (I have tinnitus, I have hearing loss at night), I couldn't sleep with the window open. Foam party next door Danza Kuduro We don't have any foam. It's a party hotel and right next door is the Granada Hotel which puts you in a bad mood with its even louder and more annoying music and entertainment. Every night there was a different party: dance groups, live music, circus, DJs... , there could be more Turkish music. The music playing from boomboxes by the pool can drive you crazy after a few days. Even by the pool, everyone plays music with their own sound cannon. As you walk across the footbridge you have about 5-10 different groups playing music loudly through their jukeboxes. What's even worse is that music can be heard in the rooms at any time of the day at a volume that fills the entire hotel with sound. Live music heated things up even more. What I would suggest: play more Turkish music. It was noticeable that everyone especially liked to rush to the dance floor whenever Turkish music was played. This is exactly the kind of music people want to hear in Türkiye. In order to hear some music, we lay down on the end of the deckchairs to watch the party at the neighboring Granada Hotel, that says it all. The music they play is extremely loud, starting at 9am and continuing until midnight, every day, with no consideration for the guests. Impossible to fall asleep before midnight because the loud music doesn't turn off until midnight, especially techno music that makes your ears explode. Our conclusion about this hotel: If you are looking for a party and loud music, this is the place for you! The music is a huge mess, sometimes the 80s come on then the Turkish Halay and then Abba again etc... The music in Granada in the afternoon is very good. Yorum: I actually stayed at a hotel nearby and the music and bass was so loud you could literally hear it from at least 500m away. The music was played until midnight, it was horrible. The volume of the music was pleasant and not disturbing at all. The hotel staff, all kinds of services, food and drinks, everything is great, the only problem is that the repertoire of songs has been the same for years, they are quite old, there is no innovation, they sing it to those who want a piece, it is so funny that there is not even a plum branch, we heard this at the Pier party tonight listening from afar 😂 Instead of showing useless entertainment, I wish those who are interested in the organization of the evening would add current foreign Turkish music. However, we were able to enjoy ourselves from the balcony with the music of. the hotel next door, it was so current, lively, and even with Turkish music, foreigners were having a good time, apart from DJ Sercan, it's okay, it's old-fashioned, it's old foreign languages, some Turkish languages, and it's. The music at the parties was too geared towards young people, too much tech house and modern house music, no universal house music for the over 40s. The first thing I would like to mention is that techno music is not played here all day and night. The music ends at midnight and the hotel lights go out as well. If you close your balcony door, you will hardly hear the music anymore. There are 2 tennis tables on the territory, modern music plays, the staff is smiling, they prepare delicious cocktails. Positive: No pushy salespeople No loud music, spacious area, enough sun loungers and seating, clean, large pier Beach could be wider, staff a bit friendlier Rooms facing the main street are quite noisy 173. But it is very disappointing when the music stops at 10:30pm and the surrounding hotels have parties and also play music until 1:02am. It's a party hotel and right next door is the Granada Hotel which puts you in a bad mood with its even louder and more annoying music and entertainment. You are surrounded by loud music from 10:00 in the morning until midnight at night. Those who like loud music and constant animation can look forward to it. Every night there was a different party: dance groups, live music, circus, DJs... the hotel next door, it was so current, lively, and even with Turkish music, foreigners were having a good time, apart from DJ Sercan, it's okay, it's old-fashioned, it's old foreign languages, some Turkish languages, and it's. Every night there was a different party: dance groups, live music, circus, DJs...

Hamam and massage for an extra charge (very expensive) also Unfortunately the photographer is much too expensive 132. There is a Turkish bath, sauna and spa (for a fee) on the ground floor. The one towel per day policy is really stupid, you use your one towel everywhere, at the sea, sauna, swimming pool, etc. My conclusion about this hotel is not for families with children or couples over 40 looking for peace and relaxation. Families or couples with or without children looking for peace and relaxation on holiday are not in good hands here. The room we stayed in was the Fantasy Jacuzzi room. I can't tell you the pleasure of looking at the sea and the view every day while enjoying the jacuzzi on this large balcony.

Since it's in HD, there's no problem with eating and drinking, you can find whatever you're looking for, but the main meals might be. The rooms are clean, they are cleaned regularly every day, the minibar is constantly replenished with free soda and water, the meals are varied and sufficient, you can always eat something. Perhaps the only downside to the room was that the smoke from the restaurant grill came out onto the balcony during meals. (We would also like to thank our hotel manager and PR person, who did not disturb us on the last day and prepared special meals for us.) As someone who has been vacationing in hotels for years, this is the first time I have encountered such a thing.
