The staff was not informed and took us to the room the day we checked into the hotel. By the way, you can also get water from the dispenser :))) We came here to relax, this is a place we will never come back to, I do not recommend you to come because you do not want to be hungry or avoid being shy with the staff.

We asked the staff for cutlery and while chatting with the other staff next to him he said you could get them from here. The catering service is good. Daily cleaning service. Yorum: Hotel that does not deserve two stars, horrible reception, you wait 2 hours for the room keys, you do not speak any language, not even Turkish, horrible hygiene, horrible service, for 10 days in the hotel, no one says hello to you, ordinary canteen food, all the services are below level 9. On the positive side: Good food Nice pier Catering and cleaning service 13. The spa service was nice. - The beach is dirty, there are trash cans near the sun loungers, but our compatriots take care of the order themselves, smoking a cigarette and putting it out in the sand next to their sun lounger - SERVICE - this hotel deserves the highest praise. Excellent service. Yorum: After my brother booked the hotel, I was scared when looking at the reviews here, but when I went there and saw the service, friendly staff and cleanliness of the hotel, I realized that I should not listen to the reviews here anymore. Yes, there are foreigners in the hotel, but in this heat the staff treats everyone equally, whatever their needs, and I particularly appreciate the bistro a la carte chef Hüseyin Nakit for his delicious menu and friendly service. When we entered the room it was nice to have a bed for our 2nd child (they didn't do this in another hotel I stayed in last year), there is also a snack bar service in the a la carte restaurant and the system is very good, the food is fresh and hot and the waiters serve it. There is no valet parking service. Table service areas are spaced apart. I rate the hotel very highly, the service is really great, especially in the bistro and restaurant. On the positive side, the restaurant is by the pool, overlooking the sea, the service is at the highest level, as if you were sitting in a restaurant, they bring you a menu, you choose), drinks are served in glasses, cold, the food is always delicious. We also enjoyed massages, very professional service. Ultra all-inclusive concept, I think it's the first time I've seen something like this, to avoid waste I must also point out that it is not appropriate for a hotel that offers this type of service to have paid safes. Fatma from the restaurant section for their services. The food was good, for example, they had veal one night, they pretended to have it the other night :)) The service from the staff is also good, everyone is friendly, knows their job, no one was running from one side to another. you are both turkish and male, i would say don't expect the same friendly service. The quality of service is 0/5, during the 10 days of stay the sheets were changed once, after two visits to the reception, from the first the hotel administration apparently could not transmit the information. The waiters provide their services in all areas with a smile. The service was excellent, the fish was poisoned. This is a terrible service from management representatives, totally unacceptable and inappropriate. At the same time, I can say nothing less than a huge thank you to all the service people who ensure comfort and peace throughout the stay. We opted for the 24 hour ultra all inclusive service, but alcohol service ends at 2:00pm. The service is not only that of the maids, the men working at the bar or in the lobby, everyone is extremely polite and helpful, the cleanliness of the hotel also deserves the highest rating, towels are changed daily and rubbish is removed. There are a lot of Russians in the hotel, so the music is usually in that language and the service surrounds them terribly. But overall I have no concerns about the services but I am not happy with their negligence. (You get upset when it's not given to you in a glass cup and you're constantly served by someone else.) - Only drinks service is offered on the sea side, and we also had a grumpy aunt who cooked and served ready-made pancakes. The missing point could have been the transport service to the airport, because Antalya airport is quite far away and a taxi costs about 4.5 thousand. Yorum: We visited it at the end of June 2024, I liked the department for its location, it was big, the swimming pools were good, BUT there were practically no services. Yorum: The service is very nice. Such good service I have not seen anywhere else. On the positive side, only the sea and that's it (((( Zero service The cleaning of the room is not good, to change the towel you still have to ask, and they will wait for the money to be given 🫰 When checking in to the hotel, if you arrive before 2:00 p.m. Yorum: This is my sixth time here, I come twice a year, this is my home now, the employees, the food, the service, the entertainment, they all do their job well. They bring a menu and prepare the service. I chose this hotel because of the large number of positive reviews and information that the catering service was operating in winter 2024. Also, the super nice administrator Gulya, she gave great advice on spa services and gave discounts. The most memorable disadvantages are: - there were a large number of ants in the room that were not eliminated in any way - terribly rude service at the reception (especially a Russian-speaking blonde woman who will move you to the worst room if you refuse to pay extra for something unfamiliar or refuse to combine two rooms into one - they transferred you only after we yelled at them ) - the air conditioner in the room blows on the bed, because of this we caught a cold - the entrance to the sea is very inconvenient (big waves and smooth patches) - terrible alcohol, you can't even drink it for free - monotonous food, alternating every other day. you can admire the sea from the restaurant, delicious food, very large choice, very friendly service... I don't understand why the service has received such good reviews.

Su Kaydırağı için tüm sonuçlar metni: Suitable for both young and old, with slides and a hairdresser spa center. 2 swimming pools - one smaller with slides for children, the other larger, main one, open until 7 p.m. There are no lifeguards at the pool and the slides only work sometimes. There are 3 slides in Agua, 2 of them were opened late, when they were supposed to be open at the times indicated. We took the bus to Cleopatra beach (the advantage is that there is a stop in front of the hotel and the bus goes directly to the beach) - Cleopatra beach is nice, but be careful with small children, it is too small and too deep Hotel: rooms ok, cleaned every day, towels changed, but no air conditioning in the corridors Food: poor, monotonous, in Turkey you can find a hotel with much better food Pool: ok, but not enough sunbeds, difficult to find a free place at 7am Slides: open from 11am to 12pm and from 2:30pm to 4pm Overall, the hotel does not deserve 3 stars, we regretted our choice 70. There is a swimming pool and slides. The slides are lit at certain times. And only 2 of the 3 slides work. Yorum: Hotel senza sentana is a 3 star + hotel for me, we were with family, in a super large annex room with swimming pool reserved only for people residing in this building, the fault of this hotel is the lunch and … 6. The cleanliness and size of the pool are a plus, but the good impression at the entrance to the pool is spoiled by a damaged ladder. Music, pool bar and poolside bistro. We had a standard room, with sea and pool view. The pool was sufficient. The pool is a bit small, but it's ideal and it's usually not too crowded. are organized for free at the swimming pool every day, which was very nice. - Swimming pool - forget the deckchairs, unless you are one of those who go out after 11pm or after 5am and take the deckchairs at the pool. In my opinion, the beer tastes most like it's in a restaurant over a pool bar. There are 3 swimming pools, including the children's pool (adult, child, water park), all clean and sufficient for everyone. The pool looks big, but it's quite small for a hotel. You will be more comfortable if you choose the indoor pool, it is not crowded and the water is cooler. The pool was great, but it wasn't enough because it was so crowded that you had to throw your towel away in the morning to find a spot. Yorum: Negative aspects of the hotel; 1- The swimming pool is small and the sunbeds run out after 6:30 in the morning. If you go to the pool after 7:00 in the morning, it is impossible to find a sun lounger that day. It is very difficult to find a lounge chair by the pool, as it is occupied by the same people for several days. That's why I prefer to stay by the pool. And to do that, you had to set your alarm for a quarter to 7, otherwise there would be no more room at the pool, since everyone started putting down their towels at 7:00. Pool - if you wanted sunbeds you actually had to book a spot around 7am but these sunbeds were actually in use, it wasn't the case that I was putting my towel out in the morning and coming back in the evening. The pools are ok, our daughter is very happy with the paddling pool. There is also Polish music by the pool. Unfortunately we were given a room by the pool which was irritating if we wanted to sleep around 11pm as there was loud music until late and the window wasn't closed very well so we could hear everything very loudly. 2 swimming pools - one smaller with slides for children, the other larger, main one, open until 7 p.m. Yorum: We spent our vacation in this hotel in 2023, the hotel is old, compact, there are not enough sunbeds by the pool at all, the beach is large, there were enough sunbeds there, but the entrance to the sea is dangerous, there are a lot of large stones, you can hardly enter, for fear of falling, not comfortable at all, There is nothing to do there with children, just relax by the pool. On the positive side, the restaurant is by the pool, overlooking the sea, the service is at the highest level, as if you were sitting in a restaurant, they bring you a menu, you choose), drinks are served in glasses, cold, the food is always delicious. The pool is clean, of course there are few deckchairs. We couldn't drink anything at the pool bar and bistro for 2 or 3 days because of the smell, alcoholic or not. The pools are small. Spacious and clean rooms (I'm talking about the ones on the 5th floor, I don't know about the others) The pool is clean, big and there are no problems with the sun loungers. The pool cleaning is correct. The swimming pool is very large and clean. Yorum: I would like to write an honest review about this place | Rude staff reception | Pool bar and staff entertainment was good | Food no ice cream for kids, horrible restaurant bistro bar at … 43. Let's get to the minuses, the hotel has 2 big flaws: There are 360 ​​rooms, they put 300 deckchairs by the pool. The smell at the pool bar is terrible, poor quality alcohol mixed with the toilets. He also asked, as if jokingly, "Has the AA power supply been cut off?" There were Seval and Yağmur in the pool bar, and the housekeeper sister was both friendly and helpful. The swimming pools are insufficient. You can never get into the pool because it's too crowded. All we do is swim in the pool and drink poor quality drinks by the pool. The pool was extremely dirty and we got an infection and ended up in hospital. , everyone sits by the pool, but since it was very hot, we always sat in the lobby, which is the only cool place. But since there is a swimming pool, there is no need to go to the sea. As stated in the reviews, the majority are poor quality foreign tourists, the hotel is very busy and children cannot enter the pool, it is very difficult to find a place for the pool as the towels are placed first thing in the morning. bad food, we didn't find anything to eat for lunch the first day, the rooms are not clean at all, the toilets are dirty, they charge you the money of 4 adults and give you tiny rooms, the sea is rocky, the pools are small, it's very little, in short, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, your money will be wasted, the drinks, the alcohol, the water they know 😡😡 56. I lost my personal microfiber towel near the pool. The pool is clean. We met a friend whose child had eye problems in the pool. It is very difficult to find a place by the pool, even at 8am all the deckchairs are taken. We really enjoyed the pool. The Aqua pool was in the back and the water was colder than the other pool, so we didn't much prefer it. By the pool, after 7 a.m., it's impossible to count on a deckchair. There are no lifeguards at the pool and the slides only work sometimes. The entertainment is already crap, there were no shows until the last day, nothing except pool and darts during the day. The food was the same every day, we couldn't eat anything different, the swimming pools were dirty, I got an infection and was hospitalized. We took the bus to Cleopatra beach (the advantage is that there is a stop in front of the hotel and the bus goes directly to the beach) - Cleopatra beach is nice, but be careful with small children, it is too small and too deep Hotel: rooms ok, cleaned every day, towels changed, but no air conditioning in the corridors Food: poor, monotonous, in Turkey you can find a hotel with much better food Pool: ok, but not enough sunbeds, difficult to find a free place at 7am Slides: open from 11am to 12pm and from 2:30pm to 4pm Overall, the hotel does not deserve 3 stars, we regretted our choice 70. - There was a man who was not clear whether he was the boss or the manager, but there was a table reserved by the pool and he was always served with appropriate glasses. As for the swimming pool, it was empty. The food was excellent, the pools were beautiful, especially the indoor pool was amazing. The bottom of the pool is cleaned at night, only unconscious people come from the beach with sand and pour it into the pool, it is the fault of the customers. Yes, the hotel has poor ventilation, the pool is small and the sea is bad. The hotel needs to be renovated at the end of the season, first of all, the ventilation needs to be strengthened, the hotel doors need to be urgently renewed, the variety of food needs to be increased and the swimming pool needs to be enlarged. The facilities, pool, sea, beach and staff were very attentive, the food was extremely good and enjoyable, the bistro section was very attentive to customers, Mr. in another hotel here my room was quite big but it was very dark in there, the balcony door is broken (broken glass), the bathroom door too, the room door is not very tight so you can hear a lot of noise from the lobby, the elevators work terribly, they stop practically on every floor and catch people no matter if they go down or up, paid internet in the hotel, ok but monotonous food, large choice of drinks but the plastic glasses they come with are already "used" and it doesn't look amazing, the worst thing is the smell at the pool bar, I don't know if it's just me it was offensive but it smelled like a "toilet" 😀 paid wifi - although this information is included in the hotel offer, purchased internet works fine Pros Nice and big pool, tasty food at the bar next to the pool - outside the main restaurant, access to bottled water, the hotel has its own beach access + pier, lots of shops around, cool attractions in the evening, air conditioning in the room Overall the stay was nice, but the hotel was definitely not 5 star ;) 78. On the other hand, it is almost impossible to find a place by the pool due to the problem of finding sun loungers in the morning in many hotels in Antalya. I thought I would at least swim in the pool, even if it was dirty, but last night my feet were like drums. Let's talk about another problem: Every night after dinner by the pool, 3 tables are reserved, 1 table is written as reserved, drinks are poured into 2 of them, no one is seated, the boss comes to one of them, sits down, lights a cigar and seats whoever he wants at the other two tables. The poolside bar smells really bad. The pool is nice and not too crowded. The pool and hotel seemed very small compared to the size of the hotel. Yorum: We visited it at the end of June 2024, I liked the department for its location, it was big, the swimming pools were good, BUT there were practically no services. They were always causing trouble at the pool, the sea and the bar. Minus the huge problem with the free sunbeds by the pool. There was no open buffet by the pool. There was an open buffet upstairs above the pool, provided you ate there. Delicious wraps and pizzas at the pool restaurant. There are no sunbeds available at the pool at 9am, so it's worth going down earlier and getting a seat... You must vacate your room before 12:00, after which time you will no longer be able to use the swimming pool, restaurant, etc. The only downside is that the deckchairs by the pool are occupied from the morning. There is a swimming pool and slides. There is a catastrophic shortage of sun loungers by the pool, people have to get up at 6am to get sun loungers, and it is very inconvenient to get up at such an hour on holiday. The deckchairs around the hotel pool fill up at 5am, impossible to find a deckchair. No WiFi, not enough sunbeds by the pool and on the beach, music too loud at the pool, no bottled water in the rooms, ultra all inclusive food tastes terrible. The pools were quite adequate and large. The pools seem to be cleaned every night, but the bottom is always full of sand and stones. If you want a sun lounger by the pool, you have to get up at 6am and put down a towel, otherwise you will be left without a sun lounger. Fresh fruit juices and hookah are available for a fee near the pool. Territory and beach: 2 swimming pools of different depths, heated, deckchairs are delivered permanently, music all day long. - poolside loungers can only be reserved at 5am. The rooms and the pool were cleaned daily. We had a great time with my children in the pool and water park. the hotel is beautiful, right next to the beach, literally from the pool through a tunnel. Also the cocktails made at the pool bar are nothing like beer they are watery the employees there say there is no ice and send them back they say it will be here in a few hours and off they go again they say there is still no ice did you reduce the ice in the June heat? The beach is dirty, rocky, terrible entry into the water - protruding stones with sharp edges. Yes, yes, my pseudo 5 star hotel leaves its guests who have a later transfer to the airport with only water. Beautiful rooms, clean, fresh, cleaned every day, fresh tea, coffee, different food, everyone can find something for themselves, vegetarians too, fish, various vegetables, various cheeses, vegetables, salads, even sushi was served once, I missed much more different fruits so much, because only apples, plums and oranges, pomegranates, pears 😒 like in Poland, I once saw watermelon and grapes on someone's plate [it is better to come to eat earlier, because then there is a small selection of fruits], --- --minus--- is that they do not offer packed lunches if you want to take them on a trip, but there is also a tip to bring something to the room for dinner and prepare it for the trip, you can ask for aluminum foil in the restaurant and there is no problem, when the cook even gave me the whole pie/pizza that he took out of the oven. * *Water .0.5 available without restriction in the fridges for meals and at the bar, juices from the machine as sweet as I don't know what, but it was good because you could do half and half with water from a bottle and it was ready for the road 😉 **large jetty on the beach. - Bottled water is also available everywhere - lobby, bar, dining room, bars. There are 3 swimming pools, including the children's pool (adult, child, water park), all clean and sufficient for everyone. You will be more comfortable if you choose the indoor pool, it is not crowded and the water is cooler. 3- There is only 1.5 liters of water and a few small plastic bottles of drinks in the room. Everything other than water is not renewed. Besides alcoholic beverages, you can find cola, flavored fruit juices and water. Anyway, alcohols were no different from water. Water aerobics is a failure, and mat exercises are also a failure. The alcohols are very weak, the wine is terrible, watery. The sea itself was also quite rough, with large waves, combined with large, smooth flat stones in the water, making entering the sea quite dangerous. Because you wouldn't have room on a deckchair by the water for the rest of the day. There are plenty of sun loungers on the beach, you need to have water shoes, the beach itself is nothing special, there is a bar, but we lacked nothing + a super convenient passage through a tunnel from the hotel. The bathroom wastewater smelled a bit. A very nice terrace with deckchairs and the possibility of entering the water via a ladder. However, I recommend having water shoes. Drinks are weak, especially beer diluted with water. When you take a shower, the toilet fills with water. When we settled into the room, there was free water in the mini bar, probably used by the previous guest. bad food, we didn't find anything to eat for lunch the first day, the rooms are not clean at all, the toilets are dirty, they charge you the money of 4 adults and give you tiny rooms, the sea is rocky, the pools are small, it's very little, in short, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, your money will be wasted, the drinks, the alcohol, the water they know 😡😡 56. The Aqua pool was in the back and the water was colder than the other pool, so we didn't much prefer it. Also, the electricity was cut off every day at the hotel, and the water was cut off yesterday, and we were literally left foaming. On the last day, they didn't even want to give us water just because we were leaving, we took it by force. Transfer: 3h Beach: not for children, gravel, large slippery stones at the entrance, jetty with access to the water for adults. in another hotel here my room was quite big but it was very dark in there, the balcony door is broken (broken glass), the bathroom door too, the room door is not very tight so you can hear a lot of noise from the lobby, the elevators work terribly, they stop practically on every floor and catch people no matter if they go down or up, paid internet in the hotel, ok but monotonous food, large choice of drinks but the plastic glasses they come with are already "used" and it doesn't look amazing, the worst thing is the smell at the pool bar, I don't know if it's just me it was offensive but it smelled like a "toilet" 😀 paid wifi - although this information is included in the hotel offer, purchased internet works fine Pros Nice and big pool, tasty food at the bar next to the pool - outside the main restaurant, access to bottled water, the hotel has its own beach access + pier, lots of shops around, cool attractions in the evening, air conditioning in the room Overall the stay was nice, but the hotel was definitely not 5 star ;) 78. Yorum: On July 15, 2024, my 10-year-old child was brutally assaulted while playing water polo by one of the guests, a man weighing approximately 120 kg. As the bathroom drain is clogged, the toilet is also filled with water. It is true that there is a water park in the hotel, but everything is cramped. It is impossible to find cold water. There is always hot water in the cupboards. Melons and watermelons were abundant. No WiFi, not enough sunbeds by the pool and on the beach, music too loud at the pool, no bottled water in the rooms, ultra all inclusive food tastes terrible. I call here the hotel management, pay attention to this section of the water park, which operates 2.5 and 3 hours a day, and place people who do their job properly. The water park hours are unclear and never follow opening times. After cutting it, we decided to go get some water. We stopped at the cafe in the lobby to get some water and I asked if we could have some more. I said I bought 4 bottles of water yesterday and it didn't exist. They wouldn't even give us water as we were leaving the hotel. Food: solid 4 out of 5, grilled meats, calamari, red fish steaks, white fish, starters, vegetables and fruits (watermelon, melon, ripe grapefruit, and the usual: apples, oranges, bananas), delicious sausages and cheeses for breakfast, many national dishes. Bottled water is free, take as much as you need at any bar. We had a great time with my children in the pool and water park. Also the cocktails made at the pool bar are nothing like beer they are watery the employees there say there is no ice and send them back they say it will be here in a few hours and off they go again they say there is still no ice did you reduce the ice in the June heat? By the way, you can also get water from the dispenser :))) We came here to relax, this is a place we will never come back to, I do not recommend you to come because you do not want to be hungry or avoid being shy with the staff. It doesn't matter, there is wild unsanitary conditions there, everything is as dirty as for pigs, the Google rating of this hammam is 1.8, we found out its name only later if you want a really cool massage, go to the hotel for a massage, it costs 25-30, there the Thai girls are just witches, I would take more money with me and go there 3-4 times with joy Then we went on an evening yacht, as he said, pirate ships are already for children and no one takes them, he showed us a video and a photo of an excellent white yacht, at the end there was a pirate ship, the ship itself was good, the party was cool, not for children We drank well and sang songs, it's just that the fact of lying was there from the beginning and it's not beautiful And the last one is their local water park Legends. Yorum: Hotel senza sentana is a 3 star + hotel for me, we were with family, in a super large annex room with swimming pool reserved only for people residing in this building, the fault of this hotel is the lunch and … 6. are organized for free at the swimming pool every day, which was very nice. - Swimming pool - forget the deckchairs, unless you are one of those who go out after 11pm or after 5am and take the deckchairs at the pool. There are 3 swimming pools, including the children's pool (adult, child, water park), all clean and sufficient for everyone. Yorum: Negative aspects of the hotel; 1- The swimming pool is small and the sunbeds run out after 6:30 in the morning. 2 swimming pools - one smaller with slides for children, the other larger, main one, open until 7 p.m. If you like swimming in the sea, take this into account. We didn't pay attention to it because we thought it wouldn't happen so much, but swimming in the sea was a serious problem. First of all, if there is a team you are going on holiday with that cannot swim or has little knowledge of swimming, a beach with guaranteed injuries awaits you, the beach is nothing but stones. The swimming pool is very large and clean. The swimming pools are insufficient. The sea is rocky and not suitable for swimming anyway. But since there is a swimming pool, there is no need to go to the sea. The food was the same every day, we couldn't eat anything different, the swimming pools were dirty, I got an infection and was hospitalized. As for the swimming pool, it was empty. The hotel needs to be renovated at the end of the season, first of all, the ventilation needs to be strengthened, the hotel doors need to be urgently renewed, the variety of food needs to be increased and the swimming pool needs to be enlarged. I, who have been swimming for 40 years and who think about my beautiful ring, this was the first time that I was in danger of drowning. Yorum: We visited it at the end of June 2024, I liked the department for its location, it was big, the swimming pools were good, BUT there were practically no services. It is worth having shoes for the beach and swimming. You must vacate your room before 12:00, after which time you will no longer be able to use the swimming pool, restaurant, etc. There is a swimming pool and slides. Territory and beach: 2 swimming pools of different depths, heated, deckchairs are delivered permanently, music all day long. Music, pool bar and poolside bistro. The poolside bar smells really bad. - poolside loungers can only be reserved at 5am.

Kumsal için tüm sonuçlar metni: The magnificent beach with deckchairs and parasols available, a pontoon for diving, privatized for the hotel with mini bar and crazy atmosphere, so don't hesitate any longer, a very beautiful experience lived with the family. Yorum: I really liked the hotel, well located on the front line of the beach, the food was good and the staff was friendly. The beach is dirty, rocky, terrible entry into the water - protruding stones with sharp edges. Beach towels as thick as worn parchment. * *Water .0.5 available without restriction in the fridges for meals and at the bar, juices from the machine as sweet as I don't know what, but it was good because you could do half and half with water from a bottle and it was ready for the road 😉 **large jetty on the beach. Yorum: - paid wifi 2€/day (low in terms of speed, but good in range - it can be used on the beach) - Sanitation in the rooms, horrible. - The hotel beach is rocky/gravelly. - The beach is dirty, there are trash cans near the sun loungers, but our compatriots take care of the order themselves, smoking a cigarette and putting it out in the sand next to their sun lounger - SERVICE - this hotel deserves the highest praise. - Free sauna and beach towels/deckchairs after collecting the cards. For those who want to go to the sea, there is an underground passage belonging to the hotel, there are deckchairs, a pier and a beach facing the sea. 2- The sea and the beach are very beautiful. With a sandy beach. I probably had 10 sex drinks on the beach in one day but it had no effect😂 the raki was like drowned handmade raki, we couldn't drink it. The only alcohol available at the beach bar is beer. The location is very uninteresting, far from the beach, all around there are annoying bazaars and vendors that do not allow walking on the sidewalk. The beach is very bad, you can even break your legs on the stones and there is a stench of gasoline. With a beautiful view of the beach. The beach is within walking distance, you don't even have to cross the busy street, but just below via a tunnel. What I found as a downside was the beach, it was not sand but very sharp stones that were hot during the day, making it difficult for me to walk on them. There are plenty of sun loungers on the beach, you need to have water shoes, the beach itself is nothing special, there is a bar, but we lacked nothing + a super convenient passage through a tunnel from the hotel. However, on the beach there is no problem finding a free sun lounger, no matter what time it is. Private beach reserved for guests of this hotel, separated from the hotel by a tunnel, which is good because there is a very busy street next to the hotel. The beach is rocky, it would be difficult without bathing shoes, but if you don't have any, you can easily buy them at the hotel. The location is excellent, right next to the beach and the view from the rooms is magnificent. Overall, this is a great place for a relaxing beach holiday with good value for money. Yorum: We spent our vacation in this hotel in 2023, the hotel is old, compact, there are not enough sunbeds by the pool at all, the beach is large, there were enough sunbeds there, but the entrance to the sea is dangerous, there are a lot of large stones, you can hardly enter, for fear of falling, not comfortable at all, There is nothing to do there with children, just relax by the pool. Pebble beach. Close to the beach, the underpass is a big advantage. There is a bar with cola and beer on the beach and free sun loungers. First of all, if there is a team you are going on holiday with that cannot swim or has little knowledge of swimming, a beach with guaranteed injuries awaits you, the beach is nothing but stones. The beach is quite narrow, access through a tunnel from the hotel (excellent solution), separate hotel part - this is the weak point of the hotel. The sunbeds and mattresses should be washed more often, someone could also clear this separate part of the beach of animals, cups and other rubbish once a day as it would spoil the image of the hotel. Private beach, with access through a tunnel, you don't have to cross a busy street at all, as someone already suggested. People left on the beach because of which there is no place on the deckchairs for hotel visitors. The advantages are the beach, proximity to shops, markets, places for walking, you can take a bus to Alanya, organize an excursion and see sights that are not on the tourist routes. There are staff who say things like "You've gotten used to it" to the child who goes to buy drinks on the beach. During the day, except during meal times, you can enjoy crepes at the Bistro or on the beach. Don't be fooled by the pictures of the beach as it is a public beach. The crepes on the beach and the pizzas in the bistro are very good... The hotel is across the road so you can reach the beach via an underpass, but it is very close so don't overestimate this. If you're talking about the beach, there was no one from the hotel, it was always from outside. Yorum: I usually approach reviews with caution, everyone has different needs and expectations, but this time I decided to write my review, maybe I will save someone from choosing this hotel - we are a family traveling around the world, without excessive demands, but expecting good conditions for children and the beach. Transfer: 3h Beach: not for children, gravel, large slippery stones at the entrance, jetty with access to the water for adults. We took the bus to Cleopatra beach (the advantage is that there is a stop in front of the hotel and the bus goes directly to the beach) - Cleopatra beach is nice, but be careful with small children, it is too small and too deep Hotel: rooms ok, cleaned every day, towels changed, but no air conditioning in the corridors Food: poor, monotonous, in Turkey you can find a hotel with much better food Pool: ok, but not enough sunbeds, difficult to find a free place at 7am Slides: open from 11am to 12pm and from 2:30pm to 4pm Overall, the hotel does not deserve 3 stars, we regretted our choice 70. The sea was very dirty, anyway you can't swim from the beach because you can't walk because of the stone blocks that don't know if they are concrete or rock (you can't walk because you slip because of the. The bottom of the pool is cleaned at night, only unconscious people come from the beach with sand and pour it into the pool, it is the fault of the customers. The facilities, pool, sea, beach and staff were very attentive, the food was extremely good and enjoyable, the bistro section was very attentive to customers, Mr. in another hotel here my room was quite big but it was very dark in there, the balcony door is broken (broken glass), the bathroom door too, the room door is not very tight so you can hear a lot of noise from the lobby, the elevators work terribly, they stop practically on every floor and catch people no matter if they go down or up, paid internet in the hotel, ok but monotonous food, large choice of drinks but the plastic glasses they come with are already "used" and it doesn't look amazing, the worst thing is the smell at the pool bar, I don't know if it's just me it was offensive but it smelled like a "toilet" 😀 paid wifi - although this information is included in the hotel offer, purchased internet works fine Pros Nice and big pool, tasty food at the bar next to the pool - outside the main restaurant, access to bottled water, the hotel has its own beach access + pier, lots of shops around, cool attractions in the evening, air conditioning in the room Overall the stay was nice, but the hotel was definitely not 5 star ;) 78. Public sea beach. We didn't even bring our phones to the beach because we considered it a dangerous environment. The beach bar is very poor, The hotel is never part of the ULTRA HERSEY perimeter. Very good food, great choice, excellent snack bar, additional grill in the main restaurant, great drinks and beach bar. However, the sun loungers on the beach are more available. The entrance to the sea is not very convenient; there are not many sun loungers on the beach either. Sand and pebble beach. It is worth having shoes for the beach and swimming. The hotel is beautiful, nice clean rooms are cleaned every day, very large choice of food, only near this hotel the beach is free of stones. Access to the sea is via a tunnel, fortunately there was enough space for everyone on the beach. Hotel guests and local residents come to the beach, so take care of your belongings. No WiFi, not enough sunbeds by the pool and on the beach, music too loud at the pool, no bottled water in the rooms, ultra all inclusive food tastes terrible. A pebble beach with a rocky bottom is important when planning a vacation with children. In terms of safety, the public beach is zero sea, it is not accessible because of the stones on the shore, you always cut your feet. Ultra inclusive, we didn't try much (flatbread for lunch on the beach, snacks in a bistro, night restaurant - my friend and I don't eat much). Territory and beach: 2 swimming pools of different depths, heated, deckchairs are delivered permanently, music all day long. There is a tunnel across the road to access the hotel beach (there are plenty of sunbeds under a canopy, and there is also a jetty with sunbeds and umbrellas). the hotel is beautiful, right next to the beach, literally from the pool through a tunnel. You go out to the beach. access to the sea, but you can go from the hotel to Cleopatra beach, the most beautiful beach in Türkiye, which I highly recommend... 3) Food - you will definitely not be hungry, the variety is huge Tomorrow, lunch, dinner, a buffet with sweets, there is also a bistro where you can order dishes a la carte and they will cook hot dishes for you right away, in the evening you can eat soup, and on the beach they make flatbreads with cheese from 12 to 16, they are free, remember 4) alcohol - to be honest, everything is fine Beer is poured from a keg EFES, it is good, not diluted, cocktails are very alcoholic) they do not skimp on alcohol and pour it into small packaged bottles, you can also take strong alcohol separately, it is good THE MOST INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT Tour guide Anex ELSHAT or as we called him "Elshut" He will offer you excursions Divide his words by 2 The most important and most important !!!!! - The beach is dirty, there are trash cans near the sun loungers, but our compatriots take care of the order themselves, smoking a cigarette and putting it out in the sand next to their sun lounger - SERVICE - this hotel deserves the highest praise. With a sandy beach. What I found as a downside was the beach, it was not sand but very sharp stones that were hot during the day, making it difficult for me to walk on them. The bottom of the pool is cleaned at night, only unconscious people come from the beach with sand and pour it into the pool, it is the fault of the customers. The missing point could have been the transport service to the airport, because Antalya airport is quite far away and a taxi costs about 4.5 thousand. Sand and pebble beach. Remind guests of their clothes, sand on their flip flops, etc. Anyway, you can't walk on the sand, there is no sand, even if there are small stones everywhere, you sink your feet into it. The pools seem to be cleaned every night, but the bottom is always full of sand and stones. I said I would swim to our little girl on shore. As I didn't know the bottom was rocky, my foot was injured by the waves exceeding my height as I swam to shore. The sea is beautiful, there are no waves except the playful waves on the shore. In terms of safety, the public beach is zero sea, it is not accessible because of the stones on the shore, you always cut your feet. Bland, not seasoned, not variable at all.||Same for the 4 hours, never enough, crazy queue and once there is more… 8. We had a standard room, with sea and pool view. The sea was rough and could be dangerous for those who are not very good swimmers. The sea was very stony and mossy, so we always entered the sea via the jetty, this is the Mediterranean as you know. But the descent to the sea is tragic - stone slabs (smooth), but with breaks for a foot, just in time for the leg to fall off and the wave to tip over and twist the ankle. The situation is saved by a jetty where you can enter and go down to the sea, but you have to swim because it is deep. For those who want to go to the sea, there is an underground passage belonging to the hotel, there are deckchairs, a pier and a beach facing the sea. Our room was very nice and had a sea view. The sea was rough and full of pebbles, so we couldn't go in. The same situation applies to the sea. 2- The sea and the beach are very beautiful. If you want to drink alcohol while listening to the sound of the sea on the pier, you can only drink beer. The sea itself was also quite rough, with large waves, combined with large, smooth flat stones in the water, making entering the sea quite dangerous. Yorum: We spent our vacation in this hotel in 2023, the hotel is old, compact, there are not enough sunbeds by the pool at all, the beach is large, there were enough sunbeds there, but the entrance to the sea is dangerous, there are a lot of large stones, you can hardly enter, for fear of falling, not comfortable at all, There is nothing to do there with children, just relax by the pool. On the positive side, the restaurant is by the pool, overlooking the sea, the service is at the highest level, as if you were sitting in a restaurant, they bring you a menu, you choose), drinks are served in glasses, cold, the food is always delicious. The restaurant is big, but there are not enough tables and chairs, you have to wait to be seated. -- Negative aspects: The sea is very stony and wavy. If you like swimming in the sea, take this into account. We didn't pay attention to it because we thought it wouldn't happen so much, but swimming in the sea was a serious problem. It's a shame, they reflect that to you, the sea is very rocky, you can't go in, it's a pain in the ass, lunch starts at 12:30, there's no more food before 2:00, there is some. The sea is incredibly wavy and rocky, absolutely unsuitable for travel, especially with children. My nail was completely torn off after hitting the rocks in the sea. They say the sea is very wavy, they say it is rocky, these are problems related to nature. In every hotel I've stayed in there was a sealed can of ayran, good or bad, but not here. Only pancakes and drinks are served by the sea. Our room on the 5th floor had a beautiful view of palm trees, the sea and sunsets. While we were eating, two friends stood up to us and said, “You can bring the sweet fruits to the room, we are closing this place.” The day before we left, we asked for a room with a sea view. The sea is rocky and not suitable for swimming anyway. The sea is rocky, but as the hotel has a pier and a buffet, you can easily swim and enjoy hot and cold drinks. The sea is terrible, the coastal part is full of rocks and stones. We couldn't swim in the sea, there were only rocks and we were always cutting our feet. Please do your research thoroughly and don't be fooled by good reviews. The sea is pebbly and wavy, it is difficult to enter without sea shoes, it is even better The entrance from the pier. But since there is a swimming pool, there is no need to go to the sea. bad food, we didn't find anything to eat for lunch the first day, the rooms are not clean at all, the toilets are dirty, they charge you the money of 4 adults and give you tiny rooms, the sea is rocky, the pools are small, it's very little, in short, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, your money will be wasted, the drinks, the alcohol, the water they know 😡😡 56. the sea is rocky Do not swim without sea shoes, it can be dangerous (the sea is clear and warm)... The positive point is that it is easy to access the sea, our room was cleaned regularly, even though the sea was rocky it was clear and clean. Those who can swim can enjoy the sea by entering via the pier. The food and desserts are amazing, make sure to book a table and dine at the seafood restaurant. (You get upset when it's not given to you in a glass cup and you're constantly served by someone else.) - Only drinks service is offered on the sea side, and we also had a grumpy aunt who cooked and served ready-made pancakes. The sea was very dirty, anyway you can't swim from the beach because you can't walk because of the stone blocks that don't know if they are concrete or rock (you can't walk because you slip because of the. Yes, the hotel has poor ventilation, the pool is small and the sea is bad. The hotel needs to be renovated at the end of the season, first of all, the ventilation needs to be strengthened, the hotel doors need to be urgently renewed, the variety of food needs to be increased and the swimming pool needs to be enlarged. The facilities, pool, sea, beach and staff were very attentive, the food was extremely good and enjoyable, the bistro section was very attentive to customers, Mr. When we went to the hotel we decided to swim in the sea on the first day. When I saw the pier, I liked it and jumped into the sea from the pier. Yorum: The location of the hotel on Google Maps is wrong, we had to search a lot. Public sea beach. For this reason, it is difficult to enter and exit the sea. The sea is beautiful, there are no waves except the playful waves on the shore. There are stones at the entrance to the sea and they can damage your feet, so be careful if you come. Let's talk about another problem: Every night after dinner by the pool, 3 tables are reserved, 1 table is written as reserved, drinks are poured into 2 of them, no one is seated, the boss comes to one of them, sits down, lights a cigar and seats whoever he wants at the other two tables. The animation is very bad, The sea is very rocky and wavy, non-swimmers cannot enter it. The sea is rocky and can be reached by jumping from the wavy pier. You can reach the sea through a tunnel. The camellia on the sea in the evening is beautiful. On the positive side, only the sea and that's it (((( Zero service The cleaning of the room is not good, to change the towel you still have to ask, and they will wait for the money to be given 🫰 When checking in to the hotel, if you arrive before 2:00 p.m. you will not be checked in, but if you want it earlier it costs 25 euros 💶 And if you want a sea view 60 euros The plates are dirty, the breakfast is very weak We had to leave the hotel at 4:00 p.m., check out of the room at 12:00 p.m., the bracelets were cut and you are no longer allowed to go to eat at lunch, but not everyone was cut off, there were people nearby a company of 5 people who were leaving the hotel just like that and we did not cut their bracelets either, and they went to lunch In short, I do not recommend it It is better to pay too much and go to a proven hotel And there they will only try to take money for everything 🫰 The internet is also paid, but it was indicated 3 euros per day There are still many things to pay attention to ‼️ 90. They were always causing trouble at the pool, the sea and the bar. In general, I recommend the hotel during the season when there are no Russians. The sea is pebbly. The entrance to the sea is not very convenient; there are not many sun loungers on the beach either. I liked everything - rooms with sea view, a restaurant on the 7th floor with varied cuisine, animation, a hammam. There are no sunbeds available at the pool at 9am, so it's worth going down earlier and getting a seat... The room has a sea view. Access to the sea is via a tunnel, fortunately there was enough space for everyone on the beach. Lots of pasta, rice, potatoes, chicken, fish served: trout, salmon, sea bream. There is a tunnel used to go from the hotel to the sea, the tunnel smells of urine. Yorum: I don't know if it was peak holiday season, but the hotel was very busy during the 4 nights we stayed at the hotel. It was very difficult to find a free seat in the restaurant. In terms of safety, the public beach is zero sea, it is not accessible because of the stones on the shore, you always cut your feet. The most memorable disadvantages are: - there were a large number of ants in the room that were not eliminated in any way - terribly rude service at the reception (especially a Russian-speaking blonde woman who will move you to the worst room if you refuse to pay extra for something unfamiliar or refuse to combine two rooms into one - they transferred you only after we yelled at them ) - the air conditioner in the room blows on the bed, because of this we caught a cold - the entrance to the sea is very inconvenient (big waves and smooth patches) - terrible alcohol, you can't even drink it for free - monotonous food, alternating every other day. The pluses: varied dishes, hammam, friendly staff, great entertainment staff, the sea is just a stone's throw away. access to the sea, but you can go from the hotel to Cleopatra beach, the most beautiful beach in Türkiye, which I highly recommend... you can admire the sea from the restaurant, delicious food, very large choice, very friendly service... We bought a coke at the bar by the sea. 2) the hotel itself is excellent, honestly, there are so many people and so many opinions, in advance when I look for a hotel, I also read reviews here, either competitors write, or people with a high rating on what they want Personally, I liked everything, the room was great, the sea view during dinner was excellent, but book your places 15 minutes in advance cleaning, I have a cheerful sign so that they do not disturb me all the time, so they cleaned once at my request, because I did not really need the dishes to be done! The entertainment program is also nice, all kinds of competitions and performances Disco 70 meters to the sea through a passage Wi-Fi is paid, yes, almost everywhere Turkey has become very expensive, they have high inflation, take more money for gifts 116. The sea itself was also quite rough, with large waves, combined with large, smooth flat stones in the water, making entering the sea quite dangerous. These guys aren't going to destroy the waves... There are excessive waves. As I didn't know the bottom was rocky, my foot was injured by the waves exceeding my height as I swam to shore. The sea is beautiful, there are no waves except the playful waves on the shore. The most memorable disadvantages are: - there were a large number of ants in the room that were not eliminated in any way - terribly rude service at the reception (especially a Russian-speaking blonde woman who will move you to the worst room if you refuse to pay extra for something unfamiliar or refuse to combine two rooms into one - they transferred you only after we yelled at them ) - the air conditioner in the room blows on the bed, because of this we caught a cold - the entrance to the sea is very inconvenient (big waves and smooth patches) - terrible alcohol, you can't even drink it for free - monotonous food, alternating every other day.

They used an empty and dilapidated parking lot for parking. The location is great. Location in the city center, on a 4-lane street, noisy and very busy. The location is very uninteresting, far from the beach, all around there are annoying bazaars and vendors that do not allow walking on the sidewalk. When buying the holiday I asked the travel agency for a room in a quiet location and that's what we got, we were with our daughter (20 months) so it was important to us. The location is excellent, right next to the beach and the view from the rooms is magnificent. Yorum: The location of the hotel on Google Maps is wrong, we had to search a lot. The hotel is located in a very bad location.

Table service areas are spaced apart. The surroundings of the hotel itself are a bit unattractive, we often went for a walk, but there is nothing interesting in the surrounding area. The area is rather quiet, mainly hotel-based. The rooms were comfortable, but some areas of the hotel could use a little renovation. It felt like we were in a residential area and not a complex. It was a very good stay in Türkiye, despite many fears before arrival, the hotel turned out to be a good choice and the area was great too. The area is full of shops and bars, and there are also plenty of places to go out in the evening. The waiters provide their services in all areas with a smile. The rooms, common areas and toilets were very clean. From what I have observed, the hotel's public areas are not sufficient to accommodate guests working at full capacity. The small size of the hotel area caused a lot of problems in terms of controlling our children and accessing entertainment. The shower area is open and not closed. The area is also nice, just behind the hotel there are shops, bars and very good prices for souvenirs. Nice hotel and lobby, small but well maintained area, great location for cafes/restaurants/shops.

Turkish night happened, I have never seen another shameful place that represents us like this, I am sorry, to be honest my money and my 4 days were ruined.

They are replaced every day with new ones – they must be returned in the evening and collected in the morning. Yorum: I would like to start by saying that I am really surprised by the negative reviews about this hotel, reading some of them makes me feel like I am in a completely different place. Overall, this is a great place for a relaxing beach holiday with good value for money. a little early, we can find a place. The area is full of shops and bars, and there are also plenty of places to go out in the evening. Yorum: I would like to write an honest review about this place | Rude staff reception | Pool bar and staff entertainment was good | Food no ice cream for kids, horrible restaurant bistro bar at … 43. The bar-bistro was a great place for quick snacks and beer, which perfectly complemented the main meals. In summary: the Senza Grand Santana hotel is a place that offers excellent conditions, varied cuisine and breathtaking views. The air conditioners have apparently not been cleaned since the hotel opened and their placement in front of the bed is very questionable. People left on the beach because of which there is no place on the deckchairs for hotel visitors. The advantages are the beach, proximity to shops, markets, places for walking, you can take a bus to Alanya, organize an excursion and see sights that are not on the tourist routes. While we were eating, two friends stood up to us and said, “You can bring the sweet fruits to the room, we are closing this place.” The day before we left, we asked for a room with a sea view. Of course, we were told that our manager places great importance on our Turkish customers. The Russians leave their towels on the deckchairs early in the morning and when they come to reserve a place, there are no deckchairs to be found.

It is very difficult to find a place by the pool, even at 8am all the deckchairs are taken. We took the bus to Cleopatra beach (the advantage is that there is a stop in front of the hotel and the bus goes directly to the beach) - Cleopatra beach is nice, but be careful with small children, it is too small and too deep Hotel: rooms ok, cleaned every day, towels changed, but no air conditioning in the corridors Food: poor, monotonous, in Turkey you can find a hotel with much better food Pool: ok, but not enough sunbeds, difficult to find a free place at 7am Slides: open from 11am to 12pm and from 2:30pm to 4pm Overall, the hotel does not deserve 3 stars, we regretted our choice 70. Also, you can't find a place to sit in the dining room. It is very very difficult to find a place. For the health, life and safety of the children, I will not recommend this place to anyone. On the other hand, it is almost impossible to find a place by the pool due to the problem of finding sun loungers in the morning in many hotels in Antalya. The hotel does not have a parking lot or even a place to stand in front of it. But to find a deckchair, you have to get up at 5am and reserve a place. Luckily, he then showed us a place to drink coffee and rest. I'm sure it would be very difficult to find a place to swim here. Yorum: The location of the hotel is in a very good place. Definitely the worst place I've ever been. You may have to reach every place in the hotel by elevator, which creates problems. I call here the hotel management, pay attention to this section of the water park, which operates 2.5 and 3 hours a day, and place people who do their job properly. A place that is never worth that much money. It was the most beautiful place. It's the only place where you feel special. This is the only nice place in the hotel. This place is, in a word, a disgrace. I immediately turned to the administrator of the Madina Hotel (her office was opposite the reception), I was afraid of how much money they would take from me, I understood that it was my fault, I should compensate, but I thought that they would just "go for a walk with all the money", I was so surprised and happy when she said that everything would be replaced for free and not to worry! Yorum: So place to relax. By the way, you can also get water from the dispenser :))) We came here to relax, this is a place we will never come back to, I do not recommend you to come because you do not want to be hungry or avoid being shy with the staff. 2) the hotel itself is excellent, honestly, there are so many people and so many opinions, in advance when I look for a hotel, I also read reviews here, either competitors write, or people with a high rating on what they want Personally, I liked everything, the room was great, the sea view during dinner was excellent, but book your places 15 minutes in advance cleaning, I have a cheerful sign so that they do not disturb me all the time, so they cleaned once at my request, because I did not really need the dishes to be done! When we told him they weren't there, he showed us another place to work.

Yorum: I went on vacation with my family on August 23rd, I got sick the next day with vomiting and diarrhea and needed emergency care, they call and ambulance for me and my children, spend 3 days in the hospital, no one from the hotel calls to check on us to at least show that they care about their guest. Yorum: I usually approach reviews with caution, everyone has different needs and expectations, but this time I decided to write my review, maybe I will save someone from choosing this hotel - we are a family traveling around the world, without excessive demands, but expecting good conditions for children and the beach. We wanted a family room. Even though it was a separate room, it didn't have a door or anything, and our family didn't leave us, so we truly became a family. I never left my family alone for a single moment. Yorum: We had a family vacation at the Hotel ze Senza Grand Santana from 08/12/24 to 08/18/1124. Yorum: As a family, we made a reservation for 10 days, misled by the photos and good comments. anyway, the ability of the people is certain, if you are not problem-oriented, the food is also very good, we went with three children, having a family room is a special beauty, you do not find this privilege in all hotels, three children are free and the clientele is usually families with children, it would be nicer if the activities and entertainment were more professional and diversified I hope to return next year. Yorum: I went there with my family for 5 days on August 15. There are 3 swimming pools, including the children's pool (adult, child, water park), all clean and sufficient for everyone. The entertainment staff were friendly and there were activities for children and adults every evening. 3- Nighttime activities for children are fun. As for reviews about Russian tourists, yes, there are many, but I have never seen them behave badly or drink huge amounts of alcohol, they are mainly families with children. 2 swimming pools - one smaller with slides for children, the other larger, main one, open until 7 p.m. Yorum: We spent our vacation in this hotel in 2023, the hotel is old, compact, there are not enough sunbeds by the pool at all, the beach is large, there were enough sunbeds there, but the entrance to the sea is dangerous, there are a lot of large stones, you can hardly enter, for fear of falling, not comfortable at all, There is nothing to do there with children, just relax by the pool. It may be dangerous to enter with children. The sea is incredibly wavy and rocky, absolutely unsuitable for travel, especially with children. After the meal, they have the children spanked twice from the bar, okay. If someone is looking for intense entertainment or is planning to stay with children, they may be more affected by the low level of animation and shows. They also organize a mini disco for children to keep them entertained. There is no entertainment in the evening, only." their own staff makes the children dance several times, always the same songs... As stated in the reviews, the majority are poor quality foreign tourists, the hotel is very busy and children cannot enter the pool, it is very difficult to find a place for the pool as the towels are placed first thing in the morning. There were activities to entertain the children every evening. Yorum: I went on vacation with my family on August 23rd, I got sick the next day with vomiting and diarrhea and needed emergency care, they call and ambulance for me and my children, spend 3 days in the hospital, no one from the hotel calls to check on us to at least show that they care about their guest. We ate in the children's block. Yorum: I usually approach reviews with caution, everyone has different needs and expectations, but this time I decided to write my review, maybe I will save someone from choosing this hotel - we are a family traveling around the world, without excessive demands, but expecting good conditions for children and the beach. Transfer: 3h Beach: not for children, gravel, large slippery stones at the entrance, jetty with access to the water for adults. We took the bus to Cleopatra beach (the advantage is that there is a stop in front of the hotel and the bus goes directly to the beach) - Cleopatra beach is nice, but be careful with small children, it is too small and too deep Hotel: rooms ok, cleaned every day, towels changed, but no air conditioning in the corridors Food: poor, monotonous, in Turkey you can find a hotel with much better food Pool: ok, but not enough sunbeds, difficult to find a free place at 7am Slides: open from 11am to 12pm and from 2:30pm to 4pm Overall, the hotel does not deserve 3 stars, we regretted our choice 70. all, if you have children, children's beds are very, very bad. For the health, life and safety of the children, I will not recommend this place to anyone. The food is quite sufficient for children and adults. In the evening there was entertainment for the children and they had a great time. It was usually done by one person, not many people, but the children were very happy. It's entertainment for adults and children. The small size of the hotel area caused a lot of problems in terms of controlling our children and accessing entertainment. As for the children, there is wonderful evening entertainment, lots of fun and dancing. If I had known I would have to wait 4 hours in the hallway with children who constantly complain about being hungry. anyway, the ability of the people is certain, if you are not problem-oriented, the food is also very good, we went with three children, having a family room is a special beauty, you do not find this privilege in all hotels, three children are free and the clientele is usually families with children, it would be nicer if the activities and entertainment were more professional and diversified I hope to return next year. A pebble beach with a rocky bottom is important when planning a vacation with children. If you want a non-alcoholic cocktail, they show you children. My child's bagel came out because he fell upside down, he would have drowned if I hadn't been there, but be careful, don't leave your children unattended. We had a great time with my children in the pool and water park. It doesn't matter, there is wild unsanitary conditions there, everything is as dirty as for pigs, the Google rating of this hammam is 1.8, we found out its name only later if you want a really cool massage, go to the hotel for a massage, it costs 25-30, there the Thai girls are just witches, I would take more money with me and go there 3-4 times with joy Then we went on an evening yacht, as he said, pirate ships are already for children and no one takes them, he showed us a video and a photo of an excellent white yacht, at the end there was a pirate ship, the ship itself was good, the party was cool, not for children We drank well and sang songs, it's just that the fact of lying was there from the beginning and it's not beautiful And the last one is their local water park Legends.

Spa and Wellness için tüm sonuçlar metni: Suitable for both young and old, with slides and a hairdresser spa center. The spa service was nice. Hammam spa available. I can only say thank you to the DJ and Spa team. Also, the super nice administrator Gulya, she gave great advice on spa services and gave discounts. But the spa was wonderful - very clean and friendly staff. Yorum: It was great, I was there with my family, they even gave me a massage, it was excellent! I recommend you get a massage. - The massage offered by the Asian lady is definitely worth it. Do Thai women give massages?/Asian women. We also enjoyed massages, very professional service. The Turkish bath is free, but while you are taking a bath they can tell you that there is an appointment for a massage and get out of here. In the basement there is a hammam, sauna and massages. That's why we went to get a massage at the hotel spa. We liked it very much: a 1.5-hour massage complex cost $35, a foot massage cost $15, a body massage cost $25. We had a massage from a Balinese girl, just great. I paid 15 euros for a 30-minute massage - it was the only bright memory of this terrible holiday.

In the basement there is a hammam, sauna and massages. I would like to point out that the hotel manager did nothing to remedy and protect my child's health and life from the aggressor, nor did he contact us for clarification. For the health, life and safety of the children, I will not recommend this place to anyone. Hammam spa available. In the basement there is a hammam, sauna and massages. I liked everything - rooms with sea view, a restaurant on the 7th floor with varied cuisine, animation, a hammam. The pluses: varied dishes, hammam, friendly staff, great entertainment staff, the sea is just a stone's throw away. Don't go to the $15 hammam he'll advise you to go to. It was the most disgusting hammam.

Parti Deneyimi için tüm sonuçlar metni: There wasn't much entertainment, there was a mini club and a fire show, a snake was brought in, and there was a foam party and no other activities. Foam parties are held during the day, but since they couldn't do any entertainment, they had a foam party in the evening and only the kids played.

Music, pool bar and poolside bistro. There is also Polish music by the pool. Unfortunately we were given a room by the pool which was irritating if we wanted to sleep around 11pm as there was loud music until late and the window wasn't closed very well so we could hear everything very loudly. The evenings are interesting, there is also a Polish dance and music show, so we all had a great time!! Like some Turks who were leaving last night, we were dancing the halay when Murat from the entertainment team turned off the music. There are a lot of Russians in the hotel, so the music is usually in that language and the service surrounds them terribly. Then there was live music and shows. No WiFi, not enough sunbeds by the pool and on the beach, music too loud at the pool, no bottled water in the rooms, ultra all inclusive food tastes terrible. Territory and beach: 2 swimming pools of different depths, heated, deckchairs are delivered permanently, music all day long. I can only say thank you to the DJ and Spa team. Although it is currently the use of adjacent land under dust and sun, an even more serious crisis will occur in the future when these lands are under construction. Like some Turks who were leaving last night, we were dancing the halay when Murat from the entertainment team turned off the music. Yorum: I had a wonderful holiday, thank you Senza Grande Santana, everything was great, including the animation events, dancing, delicious food and drinks. As for the children, there is wonderful evening entertainment, lots of fun and dancing.

Gece Eğlence Programı için tüm sonuçlar metni: The evening shows were often very loud - I didn't mind, but if anyone had trouble falling asleep because of the noise, they should ask for a room in a quieter part of the hotel, giving up the beautiful view. The evening shows were equally mediocre - they could have been more interesting and diverse. Then there was live music and shows. Like some Turks who were leaving last night, we were dancing the halay when Murat from the entertainment team turned off the music. Yorum: I had a wonderful holiday, thank you Senza Grande Santana, everything was great, including the animation events, dancing, delicious food and drinks. As for the children, there is wonderful evening entertainment, lots of fun and dancing. The entertainment program is also nice, all kinds of competitions and performances Disco 70 meters to the sea through a passage Wi-Fi is paid, yes, almost everywhere Turkey has become very expensive, they have high inflation, take more money for gifts 116.

Özel Menü için tüm sonuçlar metni: Beautiful rooms, clean, fresh, cleaned every day, fresh tea, coffee, different food, everyone can find something for themselves, vegetarians too, fish, various vegetables, various cheeses, vegetables, salads, even sushi was served once, I missed much more different fruits so much, because only apples, plums and oranges, pomegranates, pears 😒 like in Poland, I once saw watermelon and grapes on someone's plate [it is better to come to eat earlier, because then there is a small selection of fruits], --- --minus--- is that they do not offer packed lunches if you want to take them on a trip, but there is also a tip to bring something to the room for dinner and prepare it for the trip, you can ask for aluminum foil in the restaurant and there is no problem, when the cook even gave me the whole pie/pizza that he took out of the oven. The meals are varied, you can easily find what you want... * *Water .0.5 available without restriction in the fridges for meals and at the bar, juices from the machine as sweet as I don't know what, but it was good because you could do half and half with water from a bottle and it was ready for the road 😉 **large jetty on the beach. Remove plates from meals you no longer want to eat. Meals include delicious chicken and beef. The bar-bistro was a great place for quick snacks and beer, which perfectly complemented the main meals.

Balayı için tüm sonuçlar metni: Private beach reserved for guests of this hotel, separated from the hotel by a tunnel, which is good because there is a very busy street next to the hotel. Private beach, with access through a tunnel, you don't have to cross a busy street at all, as someone already suggested. Private hospital rooms are more comfortable.
