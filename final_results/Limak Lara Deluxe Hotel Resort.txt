There were enough pools and it was quiet because it was October. The only point we were not satisfied with was that the pools were extremely hot and there was no icing like in a spa. The shaded pools were nice though. A team that continues from morning till night, provides lessons with games, pool games, indoor sports hall, outdoor wellness area and sports coaches. Animation is not good except for poolside parties. The hotel's kitchen, bars, beach and pools were all very nice. The only downside of the hotel is that the poolside animation team is not very active. Children's pool and kids' club. The pools are so dirty and smelly that when you put on your glasses and look into the pool, your stomach turns. The animation program, parties, pool activities, sports and kids club were great. At the hotel's pool bar, Murat Bey and other friends, at the entrance, guest rilation, Mesut Bey, Enisa Hanƒ±m, from the cook in the restaurant to the service personnel, everyone was friendly, smiling and attentive. Although the hotel is operating at full capacity, the pools, bars, sun loungers and other parts of the hotel are sufficient for everyone. Comment: The hotel is generally very nice, the food is of high quality and carefully prepared, the pools are clean and hygienic, the bars have a very diverse and rich alcohol menu, the animation is very rich both in terms of staff and shows, but I would especially like to thank G√∂ktuƒü Bey from guest relations. The pools and beach are spotlessly clean. There are many pools, they are quite large. The pools were just too hot. As for the aqua park, it doesn't have a water park, it has three slides that you will get bored of after 2 days and the children's pool is definitely not enough. You wait long times for water and table cleaning. Gizem and I did water gymnastics every day. In the hotels of this type that I have been to before, the fizzy drinks that come in sealed cans during meals are served open here and they don't even have any kind of ancillary properties like water. We had a water gymnastics lesson with Gizem teacher, cycling with a music team in the field and in the evening we finished off with a zumba class with a sea view. Comment: Limak Lara deluxe is not up to deluxe standards, because there is no variety in @Snakler (pasta, french fries, some watermelon etc.). You wait in line at the bar, you give up drinking, @There is never cold water. There is a shortage of cold water, cold drinks and ice throughout the hotel. Water with it. We especially liked the fruit and water that the staff gave us as a snack when we left the hotel. (only Esra Capar is one of those who does this job justice) There could have been more poolside events and tournaments. A poolside children's festival was established. Animation is not good except for poolside parties. The only downside of the hotel is that the poolside animation team is not very active. Comment: The hotel was perfect for us, rich menus and delicious food, rooms are clean and spacious, the hotel area is spacious with a large pool area, there are bars everywhere, drinking coffee at the lobby bar and eating dessert at the sakura patisserie were our greatest pleasure. Comment: Everything was good, we were satisfied, our expectations were met, various and delicious food, clean room, large pool area, quality alcohol and fast service, we are leaving happily on 29. Comment: There was a large pool area, the rooms were clean, the waiters were serving quickly, we loved the skater waiters, the important part for us was the food, from the main course to the cold dishes, the desserts were perfect, thank you to everyone 49.

The area where the demonstrations are held is not enough anyway. The cleanliness of the room and the toilets in all areas were excellent. The beach area was narrow but adequate. The Wellness Area is very beautiful with a sea view, the teachers are very professional and the programs are detailed. There was a wellness sports area. All the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful, the food (especially the grills) is great, the cleaning -including the common areas- is very good...

This year we made our choice to have a holiday in a better place, but now that we have 3 days, we feel like we should go as soon as possible. I'm not happy that I chose this place. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because we stayed in places that I can recommend. We chose this place from Ankara - The hotel welcome was good, the rooms were clean and well taken care of, and cleaned every day. Also, he was the only one who wanted to do boxing, it was a good place to work. Comment: Location is in the most beautiful and central place of Antalya. Comment: We have stayed in Limra before, this time we chose this place. Believe me, the worst place you buy would have better desserts and be of better quality. If you are expecting a quality hotel, quality service and good food, you are in the wrong place. If you say, "What's the big deal, as long as it's a hotel," you are in the right place. We will definitely choose this place again, especially with the variety of food, the variety and taste of Turkish and Far Eastern cuisine, and the attention of the staff. Comment: We chose this place for 2 weeks with our family, children and grandchildren. We put this place and other Limak hotels at the top of our preference list.

Comment: The location of the hotel is very good, it has its own beach, a bar on the beach and indoor and outdoor alcoholic and non-alcoholic options. Comment: Service, cleanliness, food, everything is perfect, alcohol in bars is of high quality, sitting at the beach bar was very enjoyable for us, we are very happy, we liked the parties organized by the animation team in the hotel, the evening shows, the staff at the hotel reception was very attentive, see you again 36. Comment: We stayed for 2 nights and 3 days with my family, I didn't know what to write when I saw the comments, I wonder who says bad about this hotel, I am saying as someone who has stayed in Iberostar, Sherwood, Rixos Belek, Barut and many other Antalya hotels, it is a very very nice hotel, cleanliness, food, desserts, beach, proximity to the sea, adequacy of the pool, what more could you want in a hotel, I wonder, moreover, the price performance is very very good compared to the hotels I have listed, don't hesitate, October fest was great too, it would be nice if you coincide, the employees, the waiters, everyone was very smiling and helpful. The beach is perfect. The pool, beach garden, was very clean and the staff was attentive. We played bocce on the beach and it was fun. Especially the food variety at the restaurant on the beach is excellent. The hotel's kitchen, bars, beach and pools were all very nice. The beach area was narrow but adequate. The staff and bars were good, we sat mostly on the beach. The pools and beach are spotlessly clean. We played volleyball with the animation team on the beach and had a lot of fun. The size of the hotel was very good, the sea was beautiful, the sand was a little pebbly but this was not the hotel's problem. Comment: My holiday was great, we had low expectations when we came to the hotel because it was winter season, but Limak surprised us, the food variety is plentiful and delicious, the animation is very entertaining, the service is fast and hygienic, the bars have a variety of cocktails and most importantly, starting from the reception entrance, in every area I entered and visited in the hotel, the staff were friendly and helpful. The size of the hotel was very good, the sea was beautiful, the sand was a little pebbly but this was not the hotel's problem. The rooms were clean and had a nice sea view. But unfortunately the sea is very wavy and dirty. Apart from seafood, other dishes are delicious. The sea was sometimes wavy but clean... The sea is wavy in the afternoons in July and more swimmable in the mornings.

In the hotels of this type that I have been to before, the fizzy drinks that come in sealed cans during meals are served open here and they don't even have any kind of ancillary properties like water. There is no food issue on the sea side. We did sports in the wellness area outside the sea during the day, it felt very good. I don't think this way about most hotels, but I'm already looking forward to the upcoming summer season. The sea was beautiful for Antalya sea. We had a water gymnastics lesson with Gizem teacher, cycling with a music team in the field and in the evening we finished off with a zumba class with a sea view. We said there is no time, go to the shelter, you cannot sit on the seats here, he said. The Wellness Area is very beautiful with a sea view, the teachers are very professional and the programs are detailed. The sea is wavy, very salty and very warm. and a thank you for his sincerity, his attitude, and the fun dance and sports activities he made us do every day, he made our 7 days even more beautiful, we never wanted to participate in such activities in any of the holidays we went on, but we even left the sea and went to the wellness chef G√úLEN SERIM :) The animation team really never let us get boredüôèwe left satisfiedüôè 96.

From the morning dancers to the children's activities, live music and evening party, Oktoberfest was amazing. For example, one evening a band came to play live music. Even though different groups appear almost every day, their live museums revolve around the same 3-5 songs, mostly foreign music... Foreign songs were constantly played under live music, when I went up to them and told them there were 180 Turks in the hotel, but they said they would open now and only played 2 Turkish songs.... It was great with live music. Also, the bands brought in for the live music that started after the stage event were very successful. He was an incredibly talented musician. We attended dinner there with live music. Live music is very weak and not even entertaining. The entertainment program, music and sports were amazing.
