All results text for Beach: The beach is very nice and luckily the sea is rough. The beach is twenty meters away, along the paths from the hotel building. The beach is small, the descent into the water is gradual, but on the other side of the peninsula there are no waves and no bottom immediately. The hotel is great in terms of location and beach, but we were always hungry during our vacation. I would never choose just because the beach is beautiful. There is a public beach nearby, you can choose it together with the beach. Among the advantages of this hotel are delicious food in the restaurant, a beautiful beach and a responsible lifeguard on the 2nd beach, and of course nature. The sea is very beautiful, surrounded by beautiful trees and nature, you can reach the sandy beach by going down a few stairs. You will definitely like the sandy sea and your own private beach. The location of the hotel is in a very good place, surrounded by nature, the trees are very beautiful, and we really liked the beach, there were no pebbles. The main plus is a wonderful beach and warm sea. The bay and beach are very beautiful, and the whole complex is a really nice size. ‚Ä¢ The sandy beach is clean, located in a picturesque lagoon. There is also a terrace and a bar on the beach. Even if you didn't have time to have breakfast or lunch, you won't go hungry on the beach. It is good that there is no water in it, but when you go down 25-30 steps, there is a beach that is shared by 3 hotels and only 50 meters, the beach is shaded, and in the morning the sun does not flood the beach. As you look out to sea, to your left is the West Beach Bar, offering fries, meatballs, schnitzels and drinks while you sunbathe on a sun lounger on the pier. The beach bar is open from 10 am to 4 pm as a snack bar, hamburgers, fries, nuggets, pizza, etc. They make cocktails, Pinot Colada, Mahito, Sex on the Beach, Blue Lagoon, Baileys Cocktail, Milk Shake for children and non-alcoholic cocktails listed above. In the evening, there was only a disco at the bar on the beach, there were no organized shows, and the animators were not seen either. Beach towels are given as a deposit of 5 euros, you can change them whenever you need, the deposit is returned upon departure. Yorum: The location of the hotel is very good, there is a private beach right next to the sea and sunbeds. Hotel location, food, beach, pool, everything was good. The greenery of the hotel, the hotel and most importantly, in our opinion, the own beach are very beautiful. The beach is our red line for most families with children. Hotel Incekum West is very close and its own beach is very nice. The territory is drowned in greenery, you are as if in a botanical garden, beaches - for every taste. Yorum: Nice hotel, located near the beach, with its own pool and plenty of sunbeds. A beautiful view of the sea, a sandy beach, a place for snorkeling near the rocks. The hotel itself is of medium size, the complex and the beach are beautiful and large. Pros Good location and lots of shade around Tasty food and good drinks, very good pool bar Efficient friendly service Nice beach, good entrance to clear water Cons Rooms are small but cleanliness is ok Staff's English is bad but they are very friendly Only 1 elevator and sometimes you wait and wait Reception is a bit weak if you need something a bit far from shops and so called civilization but for 1 euro you get to avsallar where you have it Overall the hotel and beach were ok. The food on the beach was bad, so we recommend going to the main restaurant during your lunch break. The drink cups on the beach are also very scratched and not quite clean. Yorum: The hotel is perfectly located in a bay with a beautiful sandy beach and an additional descent from a stone terrace for snorkelers and those who do not like the ubiquitous sand. A variety of food, something new every day, near the hotel (you have to go down the stairs), free sunbeds and umbrellas, the Internet works perfectly - it just doesn't reach the beach - many trees, bushes and various plants, surrounded by a beautiful rock. Past the pool, which is beautifully nestled among the trees, you descend a few steps to the beach or pier. BEACH HOSPITALITY Unfortunately, in our opinion, the hospitality on the beach was poor. I didn't find anything vegetarian on the beach other than fries and small pieces of dough (which are sometimes very tasty, sometimes completely soggy, depending on the day) during my entire vacation. on the beach COMMUNICATION The hotel is mainly visited by Russians, Lithuanians and Germans. No one told us where to find the restaurant, what the hours are, or how to get to the pool, beach, or gym. I find it very impractical for the beach. Yorum: I left the hotel yesterday and the staff was friendly, the beach was sandy, although I hesitated to other guests who warn about the food in the comments, we had enough, we were not hungry. Beautiful nature, a well-kept garden and a private sandy beach, and on the other hand - access to the sea and the possibility of diving...

The beach is simply great: there are very few people, there are always free sunbeds, such a bay among the rocks, maximally protected from waves, regardless of the weather, it is very convenient for children to swim, fine, sand - the scenery is very beautiful! The beach is super beautiful. The beach is beautiful; but it is very little. It shares a small beach with a nearby hotel. While the bartender at the beach bar is very polite, chatty, asks how you're doing and asks you to come again, the bartender at the pool bar makes you a drink while staring at you, as if to say don't come, neither wishing you well, nor the success that meets your wishes. The beach is wonderful. It is especially noticeable that he does not greet us many times, even when he passes us or even when we have seilogs with us on the beach. The territory of the hotel is excellent - picturesque, beautiful landscaping, many free sunbeds located in different places - on the pier, beach, slope. There is a bar on the beach, they cook burgers and tortillas. Injekum beach is nearby - it's great, but if you need at least some shopping, you'll have to go. Comment: A wonderful hotel with its own beach. The hotel is small but a good hotel in terms of location, beach, sand, etc. Several options for beaches and diving. The only thing I didn't like was the internet - it's very slow, even photos take a long time to load, periodically disconnects, and there's no internet at all on the beaches, it was boring to lie down and sunbathe, you have to either talk to someone or pick up a book. Very good conditions for swimming, although there is not enough beach to sunbathe. Comment: I wanted to get to the hotel not on long sandy beaches, but on mixed ones. Three types of beach, sandy, from the pier and still sandy, the third beach is further away, 10 minutes on foot.

Yorum: The location of the hotel is very pleasant, as if it is surrounded by the sea and nature, the staff is friendly, the beach is small but beautiful, it is a hotel dominated by foreign tourists, but it did not bother us.

Cakes are served and there are drinks and burgers and fries on the sheltered beach until you can eat them. And the beach bar (a bar on the beach), in which hamburgers, fries and a Turkish snack were available every day (I don't know what this dish is called, deep-fried dough with cheese inside, very tasty). The beach is its own, without access for strangers, clean (garbage is cleaned regularly, sunbeds are washed if necessary). Both on one and the other beach there is a large number of sunbeds and beach umbrellas - enough for everyone. Wi-fi is moderately good, when the occupancy in the hotel is not maximum, it catches even on the beach)) Animation in the hotel is daily yoga, water aerobics, darts. The hotel stands on a cliff, so you have to go down the stairs to the beach. But even this moment was foreseen here and a descent to the beach (for wheelchairs and strollers) was made.

For lovers of long swims, it is an ideal option, the buoys are far away and you can swim along the buoys in both directions, I think there are definitely 300 meters, and then the buoys end and the unlimited space along the deserted shore begins. We did not notice any currents, countercurrents or other troubles, if you hang in one place admiring the beauty of the shore, you will most likely wake up in the same place, unless a wave moves 5 meters.

Now a teaspoon of tar: When converting a two-seater inomer into a three-seater by adding a folding bed (which is durable and convenient, by the way), the position of the double bed shifts, which makes the placement of sconces and switches inconvenient - a couple of times, when trying to get out of bed, I firmly pressed my head against the steel frame lamp But this is a trifle that does not spoil a pleasant stay at the hotel. A little worryingly, seawater sometimes contains leaves. It is nice to have a quiet and private place for two people to relax with a beautiful view of the sea in the evenings. Apart from the territory and the beautiful sea, there is nothing good there. For some reason, I don't want to come back here again, even though the sea is beautiful.

From the 5th floor there is a very nice view of the sea. Comment: Poolside room with sea view. Tables in the bar on the edge of the slope among the trees with a beautiful view of the sea. There is a solution for this, because the hotel has several small "platforms" with sunbeds near the sea, where you can only listen to the sound of the sea :). The distance from the sea to the hotel is very long. Also, I don't know the reason anymore, but we and a few other families also saw that cases of nausea and diarrhea were very common. I don't know if it's the sea, the pool, the food or the air. The pool and the sea are wonderful. Tolza at the front desk that we were going to change clothes to swim in the sea and go to the spa, where the lady on duty warned us to be quiet like children so as not to disturb those who who does the massage, anyway, we didn't bother with it, but there was one cabin, if you wanted to change as a family, you had to wait in line.

Even if there are waves on the sea and a red flag is hung in the bay, the water is calm and clear. Although it is so good, the noise of the waves is everywhere. There were almost no waves. The location of the hotel is excellent, the beach, which is not affected by the waves, is wonderful. Since there are no waves here, it is also very suitable for families with children. Moreover, there are almost no waves in the closed bay.

All results text for Service Quality: Comment: Very good hotel, friendly staff, delicious food. I reported this situation to the check-in staff and the ETS tour guide and even asked to change the room. The blue-clad wait staff was extremely spoiled and inexperienced. Yorum: The staff is friendly, the cleaning in the room is bad, the bed linen was not changed, they brought new sheets and did not make them themselves, they were given to us, and we dressed them ourselves. The staff speaks English, Russian, Turkish, German, Polish and understands something else. With the exception of the lady at the front desk, the staff were generally friendly, small and cramped but clean. Most of the guests were tourists, there were 2 Turkish families, but the staff, who paid more attention to foreign tourists and preferred them, did not leave a good impression to prefer again. The hotel was nice and the staff were friendly. The only other drawback was the limited level of spoken English from the staff, this is due to only receiving 1-2 groups of English speaking visitors per year, with the majority of guests being German or Russian. The hotel staff is polite and friendly, they mainly spoke in English. Everything is clean, the food is great, and the staff is friendly (even if they only speak limited English or Russian). ‚Ä¢ Very kind and attentive staff at the reception. Quietness at night, competence of staff, cleanliness, comfort, etc. You can't be mediocre in such a place, the staff is trained and knows their job.

The staff is not at all aimed at creating comfort and assistance for hotel guests. Finally, coming to the most important question: there is no standard among the staff, some are very good, some are very bad, there is no in between. (He tried it more than once) Again, while some waiters and busmen in the restaurant mock themselves by asking, "Would you like a drink or any requests, sir?", our gray-haired brother in the blue shirt, with a high rank, can many times look at your desk, I mean there's no staff between them.

Yorum: Very nice and nice hotel place good food good service they don't expect tip We gave because they earn very little I will add that it is two hours to drive from the airport. Comment: If you are coming from Antalya airport, study the road carefully because it is very far. Employees are trying to satisfy customers as much as possible, but there is a general problem in the business. Alanya is about 30 km away (30 minutes by bus from the hotel - 5 euros for 2 people), and Antalya is 1.5-2 hours by car. A variety of food, something new every day, near the hotel (you have to go down the stairs), free sunbeds and umbrellas, the Internet works perfectly - it just doesn't reach the beach - many trees, bushes and various plants, surrounded by a beautiful rock. There is a small shopping center about a 20 minute walk to the east, or you can catch a bus to one of the surrounding towns. Wifi reception is good, it works everywhere including the garden and as far as I understand they limit the speed to 10mbps per person, you can say it is enough for business and entertainment, you have to go to your room and TR ID information. (He tried it more than once) Again, while some waiters and busmen in the restaurant mock themselves by asking, "Would you like a drink or any requests, sir?", our gray-haired brother in the blue shirt, with a high rank, can many times look at your desk, I mean there's no staff between them. It takes 15-20 minutes by bus to the nearby village with shops and cafes. There is also a gym, but it is not in working condition, the husband was upset:) There is a bus stop near the hotel - you can go to Avsallar and Alanya, if anything - the guides will tell you everything. Getting to Alanya from the hotel by bus costs 4 euros for 2 people. you also have to pay for the safe, 2 euros per day, there is almost no animation, in the evenings it‚Äôs terrible how boring and nothing to do, the air conditioner does not work in the lobby, you can die from the heat, there are not enough sunbeds by the sea for everyone, drinking water too, they put a box in the dining room with small bottles that empty immediately, juice in vending machines, on which it is noted that it is 100%, powder, and further diluted to the limit with water, the cleaning of the rooms is normal, especially good after tipping, but not every day, the elevator is very slow and always busy, you're going to wait. The wonderful waiter Mahmed (sorry if I spelled his name wrong) spoke to us in English and taught us the word "ashtray" :) a really nice person who always found a moment to talk in his busy schedule :) Overall the service was very good, although many people do not understand English. A small hotel, away from the busy road, surrounded by a lot of greenery, fruit trees and various flowers. You can't be mediocre in such a place, the staff is trained and knows their job. There was no problem with parking. Parking is sufficient. They have private parking lots, but we Turks are not allowed. Comment: The resort is worth recommending because of its location and lush vegetation. The location of the hotel is very good, it's a pity... The hotel is great in terms of location and beach, but we were always hungry during our vacation. Yorum: I am writing from our last day, hotel location. The location of the hotel is in a very good place, surrounded by nature, the trees are very beautiful, and we really liked the beach, there were no pebbles. The location is very good, we stayed by the sea, away from the main road, quiet was important to me. Yorum: The location of the hotel is very good, there is a private beach right next to the sea and sunbeds. Hotel location, food, beach, pool, everything was good. The location is great, being in nature.

Comment: The location of the hotel is good, the stairs leading to the beach are careful. The somewhat distant location between the two cities has its pros and cons: If you're looking for shopping and nightlife, you're definitely in the wrong place. Yorum: Location and staff are great. The location and photographer are AWESOME. Yorum: The location and place are great, the snack is very good, I would prefer a nice hotel. Yorum: The hotel is in a beautiful location with rocky plateaus and a beautiful sandy beach. This is a good location. Yorum: Let me talk about the good aspects first: the location of the hotel is good, the view is good, the landscape is good, the housekeeping is good, the pool is clean. Even though it's in a quiet location, it's quite disturbing that it's on the Akdeniz Kordon highway and you can hear the sounds of cars at night because the balcony door is open. The location is not great. The hotel is small but a good hotel in terms of location, beach, sand, etc. When choosing a hotel, we read the reviews, but did not attach importance to the reviews in which poisoning appeared, we thought the same, we really liked the location of the hotel and its nature. Yorum: The location of the hotel is very pleasant, as if it is surrounded by the sea and nature, the staff is friendly, the beach is small but beautiful, it is a hotel dominated by foreign tourists, but it did not bother us. The location of the hotel is excellent, the beach, which is not affected by the waves, is wonderful. Yorum: 1-The location is very good 2-the rooms are clean, the hotel is generally clean 3-The sea is shallow and sandy, you can see swimming fish. The good part: The location and the room, especially on the sea, are great. The vegetation in the hotel is simply mesmerizing - one continuous location for beautiful photos) The plants are very well cared for, watered daily. Yorum: First of all, the good things I had to say are the location of the hotel, the sea and the view from the room. In general, if you forget the story with relocations, I really liked the hotel. A large number of different locations for recreation. The hotel is located in a great location! Instead, the location and grounds are better than most nearby hotels. The location is far from populated areas. The hygiene is very good, the food is very tasty, the rooms are new and clean, the location is very good, there are daytime activities. Yorum: The location of the hotel, the sea is very beautiful, the beach is completely sandy, the food is good, you won't stay hungry, but you won't eat to death, and there are always flies, the breakfast is very inadequate, I had enough bagels, without potatoes, for example. Comment: The location is very good. The location of the hotel and the beach are very good, I recommend it to everyone. In the hotel, it is better to take a room with a view of the sea, surprisingly, due to the location of the hotel on the cape, it is in this part that there is a minimum of sun in the windows. Somewhere in the distance, a guy was passing by, but he didn't offer anything, neither water aerobics, nor contests, nothing. There is nothing within walking distance. The distance from the sea to the hotel is very long. There is a public beach nearby, you can choose it together with the beach. (Now the noise of the discotheque of the nearby hotel was added to the elevator and car noise - and it's almost midnight, apparently Turkey's noise laws don't work in hotels). I do not recommend a room with a view of the mainland (very noisy: road noise, discos from a nearby hotel until midnight and delivery to the hotel). There are also small bazaars outside the hotel complex, but nothing else nearby. Everything is fine, but I recommend taking into account the fact that there is practically nothing nearby except for other hotels and a couple of shops. It shares a small beach with a nearby hotel. If you need more, there is a store nearby. The sounds of attractions and discotheques from nearby hotels disturb. It takes 15-20 minutes by bus to the nearby village with shops and cafes. Injekum beach is nearby - it's great, but if you need at least some shopping, you'll have to go. But the animation of the nearby Utopia Hotel keeps you awake until one o'clock in the morning. It is better to take a room higher than the "Standard" category - they are very simple, and do not take a room with a view of the yard - the disco in the nearby hotel lasts until 12:00 at night; 3. Of the pluses, the sea is nearby, sand, a beautiful pool and greenery around, but the territory is small, well-kept, the beach is very small. Instead, the location and grounds are better than most nearby hotels. I would choose this hotel again and pay a lot more if they improved the kitchen a bit ;) Not much to go nearby so a hotel for people looking for a relaxing but memorable stay. Then we went to Insekum beach, the sea is very beautiful, but there are not many sunbeds, we sat down on a sunbed of a nearby hotel, they came and cleaned it, and the towels are still there. I once heard this from a nearby hotel, only if the food is good, it is a small, minimal, very nice hotel. There is nothing within walking distance. The second plus is a green area, you can always find a shadow. A green area, an oasis. Its area is very wide. However, if you want to spend a relaxing holiday and explore the surrounding area on day trips, we can recommend this hotel. We were very pleased with our daughter Ramsier in the lobby, our daughter Syla and all the young staff in the dining area. A beautiful area immersed in greenery, surrounded by pine and palm trees. There is a small pool and entertainment areas for children. Very green, blooming, well-kept area, beautiful views everywhere, very clean. The hotel is good and very beautiful, the large green area is a beauty. In general, the hotel for 4 is a beautiful area, cleaning is done every day, the staff, especially Tolga, is mega-nice and responsive. There is no breakfast area in the room, it is tiny. Comment: Nice hotel with a very nice area, neat and comfortable rooms, good food. Yorum: I can't imagine finding a hotel in this area with better grounds and views. The beach is good, you can find places because the area is large, the sea is very beautiful. The location is far from populated areas. Comment: A small but beautiful area. The room is ordinary, there is a shower and a bed, there are two chairs and a table on the balcony, but why sit in the room if there is such a beautiful area and a bar... Finally, there are many and varied swimming areas, which is a big plus. Yorum: I can't understand the negative reviews at all, for me this is the most beautiful outdoor area on the Turkish Riviera. As we have been spending our family summer vacations in the beautiful seaside places of our country for years and have stayed in many hotels, this is not the first time we have come across a hotel that was so careless and failed to maintain hygiene. There are many sunbeds and they are located in different places. The location of the hotel is in a very good place, surrounded by nature, the trees are very beautiful, and we really liked the beach, there were no pebbles. The negative points are that the tables in the restaurant part are too close, the rooms are small, there is no aquarium, apart from these, we were satisfied with the price and performance, I recommend this place. You can't be mediocre in such a place, the staff is trained and knows their job. We did not notice any currents, countercurrents or other troubles, if you hang in one place admiring the beauty of the shore, you will most likely wake up in the same place, unless a wave moves 5 meters. If you are looking for a quiet place to relax, this could be a great option. A beautiful view of the sea, a sandy beach, a place for snorkeling near the rocks. Comment: A very nice place to relax. Every day we found a place on the sunbeds, as well as an umbrella. Of course, we have been to places where there were mountains of food, but is that the point? There is no place to park the car. The somewhat distant location between the two cities has its pros and cons: If you're looking for shopping and nightlife, you're definitely in the wrong place. Yorum: Very nice and nice hotel place good food good service they don't expect tip We gave because they earn very little I will add that it is two hours to drive from the airport. Yorum: The location and place are great, the snack is very good, I would prefer a nice hotel. But if you want a cool vacation, without screaming children and unnecessary fuss, this is the place for you. In other words, there is no atmosphere, no place, no entertainment, you buy a tequila or whiskey that money bought, sit on a chair in the garden and drink it, it shouldn't be that expensive. Now a teaspoon of tar: When converting a two-seater inomer into a three-seater by adding a folding bed (which is durable and convenient, by the way), the position of the double bed shifts, which makes the placement of sconces and switches inconvenient - a couple of times, when trying to get out of bed, I firmly pressed my head against the steel frame lamp But this is a trifle that does not spoil a pleasant stay at the hotel. It is nice to have a quiet and private place for two people to relax with a beautiful view of the sea in the evenings. The territory of the hotel is excellent - picturesque, beautiful landscaping, many free sunbeds located in different places - on the pier, beach, slope. Comment: Extremely beautiful and cozy place! In everything else - a good four, a pleasant atmospheric place, where you want to return again! We still danced a little with pleasure)) Although we disturbed the peace and quiet of the place. Will definitely come back, very nice place! Many places where you can sit at a table, talk in the fresh air and drink something good, including alcohol, but in very limited quantities. it is better to pay extra and go to a better place. Apparently, unsanitary conditions in this hotel are commonplace year after year. A very nice place to relax. If you plan to practice yoga, it will not work, there are no separate places in the hotel. I'm serious, if you want to stay hungry and lose weight, this is a very good place. Territory Rating: 4 The territory of the hotel is small, but at the same time there is a place to walk/sit/seclude. Yorum: *Pros: The hotel is perfectly located on the seashore, where there are many places to sunbathe. Since there was nothing in this town but hotels and bazaars, it would be helpful if the hotel provided some interesting places in the evening... Many places to sunbathe on different levels. Yorum: Rested at the beginning of September for 22 years, the atmosphere in the room is normal, the food is bad, the choice is scarce, almost always the same, for breakfast an edible boiled egg and coffee, no pancakes, no scrambled eggs, not even sausages, lunch is monotonous, the choice is scanty, not tasty, even though we had everything included, we ate only at the appointed time, near the pool and on the sea, the bars almost never have anything for a snack except beer, you had to buy towels for the beach, 10 euros for one, which were changed once once a day, if you hand in a towel after lunch, you will not receive a dry one instead, only tomorrow, and the women who receive them send you to put them in a certain place, so they point with their finger, put it there... The beach is good, you can find places because the area is large, the sea is very beautiful. If I have the chance next year, I will choose this place again.

Rating for Water Slides: 7.5
Total number of comments for Water Slides: 108
All results text for Water Slides: The pool was not used and there are no slides. He opens and takes the door, lifting the slider. The pool is normal. If you, like us, want to relax in a quiet hotel with the sea and a pool surrounded by trees, definitely choose this hotel. The pool is quite large. Music plays in the pool, there are several activities: exercise, darts, water polo, dances/discos/contests/karaoke in the evening. In the afternoon, ice cream and waffles are served at the poolside bar, and tea and dessert are served in the lobby. The pool bar serves delicious Turkish coffee. ‚Ä¢ They did not swim in the pool. But there is a pool for adults and a children's pool. In front of the hotel there is a pool shaded by trees, it does not get too hot in the pool. The pool bar serves ice cream every other day, waffles are baked every other day, it says from 15 to 18, in fact from 16 and ends earlier. Next to the pool bar is a terrace with great views and coolness even during the day. It is not known that there is a lush garden, a sea pool, great food. As a plus for me, half the pool is surrounded by trees and the shade means I don't get sunburned. Hotel location, food, beach, pool, everything was good. I can say that there is no animation after dinner or by the pool during the day. Yorum: Nice hotel, located near the beach, with its own pool and plenty of sunbeds. Pros Good location and lots of shade around Tasty food and good drinks, very good pool bar Efficient friendly service Nice beach, good entrance to clear water Cons Rooms are small but cleanliness is ok Staff's English is bad but they are very friendly Only 1 elevator and sometimes you wait and wait Reception is a bit weak if you need something a bit far from shops and so called civilization but for 1 euro you get to avsallar where you have it Overall the hotel and beach were ok. Ice cream at the pool bar is available from 16:00, unfortunately we only found out on the penultimate day. Past the pool, which is beautifully nestled among the trees, you descend a few steps to the beach or pier. No one told us where to find the restaurant, what the hours are, or how to get to the pool, beach, or gym. The pool was very clean. Darts and pool sports are also offered once a day. The playlist works by the pool all day. No waiters to bring drinks by the pool/beach. There are sun loungers by the pool for sun lovers, but there are also plenty of shady spots under the trees for those who don't like it too hot. Friendly and caring staff rooms are clean The sea is sandy and has its own bay, clean The pool is clean and quite big Delicious food, breakfast included Quiet hotel without chaos We would like to thank our sister, the room cleaner on the 5th floor, Ms. Let's come to the hotel, the pool is very good and sufficient, you need to leave your towel earlier to take a sunbed. Yorum: Let me talk about the good aspects first: the location of the hotel is good, the view is good, the landscape is good, the housekeeping is good, the pool is clean. There is no food, no pool, no sea until you wake up in the morning and go to bed at night, the hotel is known to die. The pool bar said we were going to take out after 11pm, I thought we had to pay for something decent, but they said 1 shot of tequila was ‚Ç¨5 so I declined. While the bartender at the beach bar is very polite, chatty, asks how you're doing and asks you to come again, the bartender at the pool bar makes you a drink while staring at you, as if to say don't come, neither wishing you well, nor the success that meets your wishes. The pool is cool and clean. There is a small sandy bay and a swimming pool. There is a small pool and entertainment areas for children. Ice cream is also served on some days, and pastries can be found at the pool bar at certain times of the day. By the way, we didn't swim in the pool either, only in the sea. Comment: Good for the weekend, good pool, close to the sea. The pool was not used and there are no slides. The pool bar treats, called coffee hour, consisted of 4 or 5 cakes and they were the same every day. Since the time was not crowded, we liked both the pool and the sea. There are also 2 pools - a large one for adults (140 cm deep) and a small one (shallow) for very young children. Also, I think there is a virus in the pool (we thought it was from the pool) because I talked to 5 people at the hotel and they said our kids threw up. We don't go to the pool out of caution. Lifeguards are on duty at the beach and pool. Yorum: Rested at the beginning of September for 22 years, the atmosphere in the room is normal, the food is bad, the choice is scarce, almost always the same, for breakfast an edible boiled egg and coffee, no pancakes, no scrambled eggs, not even sausages, lunch is monotonous, the choice is scanty, not tasty, even though we had everything included, we ate only at the appointed time, near the pool and on the sea, the bars almost never have anything for a snack except beer, you had to buy towels for the beach, 10 euros for one, which were changed once once a day, if you hand in a towel after lunch, you will not receive a dry one instead, only tomorrow, and the women who receive them send you to put them in a certain place, so they point with their finger, put it there... Of the pluses, the sea is nearby, sand, a beautiful pool and greenery around, but the territory is small, well-kept, the beach is very small. The pool and the sea are beautiful. The territory is full of greenery, flowers, insanely beautiful))) Swimming pool, gym, massage. Comment: Poolside room with sea view. Yes, it's about loud music by the pool. (of course, this was not a very pleasant surprise, in the store next to the hotel, ice cream is sold for $1-2 quite a lot) The lifeguard on the beach of the hotel does not just sit and look at the vacationers, he always helps to find a sunbed, brings it if there are none or cleans the sand for you (very surprised) The pool is surrounded by needles (there are many needles around) and the water is cleaned reluctantly and not every day either ! Unkept, leaves floating in the pool, devastation around. I don't know if it's the sea, the pool, the food or the air. The pool and the sea are wonderful. The pool is large and clean, cleaned every night. The pool is small, clean and cute. Since it is located right on the beach, the pool is not crowded. The beach is small, the descent into the water is gradual, but on the other side of the peninsula there are no waves and no bottom immediately. Somewhere in the distance, a guy was passing by, but he didn't offer anything, neither water aerobics, nor contests, nothing. Music plays in the pool, there are several activities: exercise, darts, water polo, dances/discos/contests/karaoke in the evening. A large selection of fruits: apples, watermelons, grapes, oranges, peaches, apricots, cherries. When we left late at night, we were offered sandwiches, coffee and water. ‚Ä¢ Entertainment: darts, table tennis, yoga, water polo. The water in the sea is clean and warm. As the hotel owner said, the water temperature during our vacation was 27 degrees. It is good that there is no water in it, but when you go down 25-30 steps, there is a beach that is shared by 3 hotels and only 50 meters, the beach is shaded, and in the morning the sun does not flood the beach. Watermelon is delicious for breakfast and dinner, apples and apricots are delicious for lunch, and occasionally grapes and oranges. It is located on the bay and the water was crystal clear for us in June. Pros Good location and lots of shade around Tasty food and good drinks, very good pool bar Efficient friendly service Nice beach, good entrance to clear water Cons Rooms are small but cleanliness is ok Staff's English is bad but they are very friendly Only 1 elevator and sometimes you wait and wait Reception is a bit weak if you need something a bit far from shops and so called civilization but for 1 euro you get to avsallar where you have it Overall the hotel and beach were ok. The water and the territory of the hotel are an absolute dream! In addition, you always get a seat near the water, even if the hotel is fully booked. However, the toilet flush was stuck, the sink didn't drain well, we also only had ice cold water in the shower, the TV remote didn't work properly and the rooms are very noisy. The facility is well designed with lots of greenery, constantly watered and maintained. There were only 2 bottles of water of 0.5 liters in the room, and the rest had to be drunk from ordinary plastic containers of 0.2 liters. Warm, crystal clear water. Alcoholic drinks are very bad, I would believe them if they said that they use flavorings in beer, add a lot of acid and pass off water as beer, it is so sour and non-alcoholic. Even if there are waves on the sea and a red flag is hung in the bay, the water is calm and clear. A little worryingly, seawater sometimes contains leaves. The water is clean, fish swim - it's interesting to swim in a mask. The food is okay, you won't go hungry, the selection is not huge, just enough, lots of good fresh greens, but not much fruit, I would like watermelon or melon. Desserts are enough, fruits are not enough - apples, pears, melon, watermelon. Yorum: Measly breakfasts, at 11.30 they made burgers in a bar by the sea and delicious tortillas, served watermelon. Unlimited bottled water is available throughout the day. In general, there are 2 of them near the hotel - one sandy, with a gentle entrance to the water, which is suitable for small children and people with limited physical abilities, the other - with a steep entrance to the water, from the stairs and the bottom of the reefs. Wi-fi is moderately good, when the occupancy in the hotel is not maximum, it catches even on the beach)) Animation in the hotel is daily yoga, water aerobics, darts. The vegetation in the hotel is simply mesmerizing - one continuous location for beautiful photos) The plants are very well cared for, watered daily. you also have to pay for the safe, 2 euros per day, there is almost no animation, in the evenings it‚Äôs terrible how boring and nothing to do, the air conditioner does not work in the lobby, you can die from the heat, there are not enough sunbeds by the sea for everyone, drinking water too, they put a box in the dining room with small bottles that empty immediately, juice in vending machines, on which it is noted that it is 100%, powder, and further diluted to the limit with water, the cleaning of the rooms is normal, especially good after tipping, but not every day, the elevator is very slow and always busy, you're going to wait. The beach in the bay with clean and warm water. (of course, this was not a very pleasant surprise, in the store next to the hotel, ice cream is sold for $1-2 quite a lot) The lifeguard on the beach of the hotel does not just sit and look at the vacationers, he always helps to find a sunbed, brings it if there are none or cleans the sand for you (very surprised) The pool is surrounded by needles (there are many needles around) and the water is cleaned reluctantly and not every day either ! Alcohol is tolerable, if you are a connoisseur - take it with you) The juice is disgusting (((all flavors, the child was drunk only with water). It's all in the details, the taps don't open well, the shower doesn't have a single door, so water flies all the way into the corridor. And it's for the sake of the workers' water. Fresh fruits, sweet watermelons and melons, various sweets. Access to drinking bottled water around the clock. Gin is fine, beer is too watery. The water is crystal clear, there are no pebbles or stones to disturb you like on other beaches. The showers on the beach may sometimes have water, but sometimes not. Water handball, shooting. The sea is crystal clear 80% of the days and great for swimming. There is a small sandy bay and a swimming pool. Very good conditions for swimming, although there is not enough beach to sunbathe. Yorum: 1-The location is very good 2-the rooms are clean, the hotel is generally clean 3-The sea is shallow and sandy, you can see swimming fish. The territory is full of greenery, flowers, insanely beautiful))) Swimming pool, gym, massage. Finally, there are many and varied swimming areas, which is a big plus. In the afternoon, ice cream and waffles are served at the poolside bar, and tea and dessert are served in the lobby. Comment: Poolside room with sea view.

All results text for Baby-Friendly Holiday (0-2 Years): But even this moment was foreseen here and a descent to the beach (for wheelchairs and strollers) was made. As we have been spending our family summer vacations in the beautiful seaside places of our country for years and have stayed in many hotels, this is not the first time we have come across a hotel that was so careless and failed to maintain hygiene. Definitely suitable for a relaxing family vacation. We did not experience any problems as a family with a 3-year-old child, everyone had a good time and rested. Comment: Very suitable for a family holiday, the staff is friendly, the rooms are clean. Yorum: We returned yesterday from our family vacation during Eid al-Adha. Yorum: We rested as a family in June, we were very satisfied with the hotel, everything is clean and beautiful, the rooms are clean and not tired, clean towels, the rooms are cleaned every day. Yorum: We spent a very pleasant vacation with friendly and young staff in a family atmosphere. Yahya and all the canteen staff, I would like to thank All of them for creating a family environment for us. Kaplan family 62. A purely family hotel, no insults, few people who shouldn't be around, most were Russian and German tourists. We traveled as a large family. After all, it is positioned as a family hotel. First, let me talk about the pluses we were given, although we chose a ground room, I think they gave us a family room. Yorum: Small family hotel. The hotel staff are people who make you feel like a real family. First of all, we would like to thank you, Miarosa Incekum West Resort Family, for your efforts during our stay with respect. As I later heard, there are also family rooms. We like it to be quiet, cozy and family-friendly. Tolza at the front desk that we were going to change clothes to swim in the sea and go to the spa, where the lady on duty warned us to be quiet like children so as not to disturb those who who does the massage, anyway, we didn't bother with it, but there was one cabin, if you wanted to change as a family, you had to wait in line. There was no banana or strawberry to feed my little baby, she was always dry hard, no red meat even one day, fried turkey and rice every day, always the same food, potatoes for the baby in diner, I wanted to feed him but horrible person can't even fry - had terrible potatoes, they were very heavy, my child could never eat them, especially the lady who worked there was very rude. Also, the day before we checked into the hotel, we checked if there was a baby cot, they said "yes, don't bring it". Yorum: Hi, my wife and I stayed for 4 days with our 9 month old baby, we were hesitant to come but we had a lot of fun. There were also no activities for children. There is absolutely nothing for young people and children to do in the hotel. There is not even a children's room. But there is a pool for adults and a children's pool. They make cocktails, Pinot Colada, Mahito, Sex on the Beach, Blue Lagoon, Baileys Cocktail, Milk Shake for children and non-alcoholic cocktails listed above. The beach is our red line for most families with children. Everyone will find food to their taste, fresh fruit for children! The sea is crystal clear here, and you can swim with children without fear. The complex is beautiful, very quiet, perfect for couples who want peace and quiet as there are few children. Therefore, it is not suitable for children.

All results text for Family Holiday (2-10 years): As we have been spending our family summer vacations in the beautiful seaside places of our country for years and have stayed in many hotels, this is not the first time we have come across a hotel that was so careless and failed to maintain hygiene. Definitely suitable for a relaxing family vacation. We did not experience any problems as a family with a 3-year-old child, everyone had a good time and rested. Comment: Very suitable for a family holiday, the staff is friendly, the rooms are clean. Yorum: We returned yesterday from our family vacation during Eid al-Adha. Yorum: We rested as a family in June, we were very satisfied with the hotel, everything is clean and beautiful, the rooms are clean and not tired, clean towels, the rooms are cleaned every day. Yorum: We spent a very pleasant vacation with friendly and young staff in a family atmosphere. Yahya and all the canteen staff, I would like to thank All of them for creating a family environment for us. Kaplan family 62. A purely family hotel, no insults, few people who shouldn't be around, most were Russian and German tourists. We traveled as a large family. After all, it is positioned as a family hotel. First, let me talk about the pluses we were given, although we chose a ground room, I think they gave us a family room. Yorum: Small family hotel. The hotel staff are people who make you feel like a real family. First of all, we would like to thank you, Miarosa Incekum West Resort Family, for your efforts during our stay with respect. As I later heard, there are also family rooms. We like it to be quiet, cozy and family-friendly. Tolza at the front desk that we were going to change clothes to swim in the sea and go to the spa, where the lady on duty warned us to be quiet like children so as not to disturb those who who does the massage, anyway, we didn't bother with it, but there was one cabin, if you wanted to change as a family, you had to wait in line. There is nothing for the kids except nuggets and fries at the snack bar. Also, I think there is a virus in the pool (we thought it was from the pool) because I talked to 5 people at the hotel and they said our kids threw up. There were also no activities for children. There is absolutely nothing for young people and children to do in the hotel. There is not even a children's room. But there is a pool for adults and a children's pool. They make cocktails, Pinot Colada, Mahito, Sex on the Beach, Blue Lagoon, Baileys Cocktail, Milk Shake for children and non-alcoholic cocktails listed above. The beach is our red line for most families with children. Everyone will find food to their taste, fresh fruit for children! The sea is crystal clear here, and you can swim with children without fear. The complex is beautiful, very quiet, perfect for couples who want peace and quiet as there are few children. Therefore, it is not suitable for children.

Rating for Party Experience: 6.1

All results text for Party Experience: Not a party hotel. Therefore, direct party people may not fit here. The somewhat distant location between the two cities has its pros and cons: If you're looking for shopping and nightlife, you're definitely in the wrong place. Music plays in the pool, there are several activities: exercise, darts, water polo, dances/discos/contests/karaoke in the evening. From the minuses: somewhere in Utopia, the music plays very loudly until late at night and disturbs sleep 17. One day there was live music. There is nothing but soft music. And the second minus is that there are many Russians there and they also play Russian music 36. In the evening there is a small disco where only Russian music is played. It feels like only Russian music is playing, because 95% of the visitors are from Russia. If you really want to look for something negative, it would be the disco on the eastern edge of the peninsula, where the music is relatively loud in the evenings, but is turned down/silenced no later than 11pm. Yorum: We stayed for 4 nights, ate, drank, bathed and rested very well, one evening there was even live music, we had a little fun. If the room overlooks the surroundings, listen to loud music from neighboring hotels until 0 o'clock. That there is no disco is a plus, meaningless music, like in all other hotels, rather annoys me. And here, the host allowed us some music and dancing near the bar until 11 p.m., for which he has great respect! As for the animation, it is a bit meager, but there is aqua aerobics (very active animators are a plus), there was live music in the evening and even a snake show with fire. Yes, it's about loud music by the pool. At discotheques, mostly Russian music is played, which is very annoying when there is a war in Ukraine. Cleanliness in the rooms is good, there were no problems, the animation is inadequate, there is actually no music, all the music is someone else's, I hung out at sea for 6 days, I did not hear a Turkish song. There are very few devices, some of them are so rusty that they can no longer be adjusted in height. The air conditioner in the room cannot be adjusted by temperature? Disco, entertainment, dancing, shows, etc. And here, the host allowed us some music and dancing near the bar until 11 p.m., for which he has great respect!

All results text for Spa and Wellness: A massage at the spa is also highly recommended. While the restaurant, bar and front desk staff do their jobs properly and are friendly, the spa and floor staff are equally disgusting.

Stay healthy and calm ü§óüëèüëèüëèüëè I would also like to thank Ms. The concept of "all inclusive" also completely failed to live up to its expectations - between the main meals it is impossible to get any healthy food, not even an elementary apple for a child - one fast food, hamburgers, French fries and various types of cookies are offered.

All results text for Special Menu: This hotel is not suitable for vegetarians, the meat is mostly very tasty. I didn't find anything vegetarian on the beach other than fries and small pieces of dough (which are sometimes very tasty, sometimes completely soggy, depending on the day) during my entire vacation. Vegetarians don't have to be picky, as most days they only eat the hot option, otherwise they have to eat a salad. The food is always fresh and we, as vegetarians, have a lot to choose from. Little variety, little choice, only salad for dinner for vegetarians. There are 6 types of meals, with each meal hamburgers, fries and nuggets are available from 11am to 4pm. This means that if you haven't had lunch/dinner, you don't have a chance to eat anything between meals.

All results text for Honeymoon: You will definitely like the sandy sea and your own private beach. Yorum: The location of the hotel is very good, there is a private beach right next to the sea and sunbeds. A private sandy bay surrounded by beautiful trees provides shade for up to 12 hours. Beautiful nature, a well-kept garden and a private sandy beach, and on the other hand - access to the sea and the possibility of diving... (July 2024) Advantages: beautiful hotel complex, cleanliness, friendly staff, WiFi throughout the complex, private beach with free umbrellas and sunbeds. They have private parking lots, but we Turks are not allowed. It is nice to have a quiet and private place for two people to relax with a beautiful view of the sea in the evenings. It has its own practically private beach in its own practically private bay.

The towels were changed only when I put them on the floor on the 5th day, the bedding was not changed, maybe it should also be thrown on the floor... We never ran out of sunbeds, there is plenty of food and drink, we never went hungry, our room was cleaned every day, the nurses on duty were very friendly and warm, perfect for anyone looking for a restful night's rest.

There is also a gym, but it is not in working condition, the husband was upset:) There is a bus stop near the hotel - you can go to Avsallar and Alanya, if anything - the guides will tell you everything.
