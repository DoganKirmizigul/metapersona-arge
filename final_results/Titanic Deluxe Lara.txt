If you are looking for a holiday that can be something for family or even just as couples this one ticks all of boxes! Yorum: First family holiday! Yorum: We recently enjoyed a delightful weekend stay at Titanic Deluxe Hotel Lara in Antalya, and overall, our experience was filled with festive cheer and family fun. The Duplex Suite featured a private terrace and jacuzzi, providing a luxurious and comfortable space for our family of four. The indoor pool water was surprisingly cold, and the presence of groups of adult males playing with a ball detracted from the family-friendly atmosphere. Great for the whole family with plenty for the kids to keep them entertained 82. Having received a polite note asking us to pay any additional fees by eight o'clock on the penultimate day at Our convenience we couldn't In fact we're in their restaurant having a family meal, costing extra On returning to our rooms both were locked out.

Rooms are very clean we are family of 4 and have 2 double beds, toiletries are replenish each day along with mini bar, our room has had clean h towels and cleaned every day, balconies are small but totally adequate. We thoroughly enjoyed our trip as a couple for our anniversary and cannot wait to take our boys back for a family trip next year!! Perfect for family's with kids and also without kids.

Yorum: We came for a week in august with family and had a great time. We would definitely come back again to Titanic Resort as we believe it‚Äôs a perfect place for a family holiday ! The lighting system in the family area is broken and every other bulb works. We came to this Hotel with Family 20 times and everything is great. The kids' clubs and entertainment, the food, and the pools were fab, and staff always rolled around, taking orders for drinks. Kids' food at the kids club was great. It would be nice to integrate some of that within the main section so kids can remain as part of the family. Yorum: Close to the airport and a very nice hotel for families specially with kids. Amazing for kids and adults alike couldn't recommend this hotel enough. Beachfront location with an excellent equipped kids play area inside and out. As a toddler it was brilliant that we had a splash pool and the kids club was superb! It's an all inclusive venue, which meant the kids and I never went hungry. We didn't make use of the kids club as we came without our little one this time but the facility looked absolutely amazing - stylishly designed, well equipped and there was a full day of activities planned each day. It's nice to see that the kids club wasn't an afterthought at this hotel as it often happens. If you have kids they will never be bored there is so much for them to do. My son 19month old got a black eye in kids group. Yorum: One of the best Hotel in Turkey, 3 years in a row we are coming back, and always there is something new, a redesign, a new pier, new playhouse for the kids, etc. Enjoyed the shows at the amphitheater and kids enjoyed the kikoa kids clubs facilities which we stayed with them for. The kids club is especially great with lots to keep the kids entertained. Kids club was fantastic (ours were aged 5 and 7), lots of activities, shows and flexibility on when you drop off/ pick up. The kids are having a blast‚Ä¶ Special mention to Even and Burak, who I had a great chat with. My kids are loving it. The kids club is amazingly well thought out & safe! Kids club was great! Kids didn‚Äôt want to leave - they have music lessons, Lego, ceramics lessons etc‚Ä¶and open till midnight. All the girls at the kids club were brilliant too and so friendly, Susan from the kids club made my daughter feel special even though my daughter is very shy. My kids loved it here. The kids club is AMAZING, with lots of activities for them. Kids club is amazing! Yorum: This is our second time at this hotel and the improvements to the pier outside restaurant and kids clubs, is 10/10. The childrens club has something for kids of all ages & the hotel is right on the beach too. Plenty of things to do for the kids. Our daughter loved the kids club and looked forward to the kids disco every night. Lots of activities throughout the day & excellent night entertainment (kids are allowed in the disco/nightclub). The programs at nights are really enjoyable especially for kids. Great for kids and so much for them to do. The kids club has just opened and it‚Äôs fantastic!! The food at meal times was really tasty & lots of variety for both adults and kids.

Yorum: Our stay at Titanic has been amazing, our favourite has been the kids club, they have soo much to do for children. We would recommend this place for kids as the kids pool is great with lots of slides. We didn't get a chance to experience the kids play area as it's currently unde construction but it looks like it'll be a really good play park. Yorum: Second time back at hotel, renovations this year have been excellent, kids club is fantastic. Sunbeds are busy but plenty of them, as with all hotels if you want a specific spot for instance round kids pool or right beside pool you will need to be up early before 8am to put a towel down. We rented a cabana, which was pricey but good, but the pier is open to everyone, so we had random people wandering in Lastly its a child friendly hotel, which is great if you have kids, as no where is out of bounds for them. Yorum: We had a great holiday lots to do for the kids and Adults very clean and Adnan in the kids club was very helpful. Perfect for family's with kids and also without kids. The aura of the hotel for family with kids and adults fits perfectly and the cleanliness and decor is simply top class. The hotel has lots of water slides and multiple activities for kids and adults. A lot of activities for kids from 0900 to mid night... The staff in the kids club are so friendly and welcoming especially the man who runs the football. Kids club is amazing all the staff are very good with children!! Nice staff in kids club. Kids club had just opened the day after we arrived that allow you to drop your kids off if you need a well needed hours rest. White party was amazing, kids loves the fireworks. My kids loved the Kikoa Club as they used to go there everyday for 3 hours, it includes many activities for all ages but my kids opted for soft play area as well as play station room. The resort also has a bowling and pool area, tennis and basketball court, football field and kids park. Not sure about allowing kids at the disco after though. There‚Äôs a great kids club too! Yorum: Service excellent , drinks lovely , the kids really enjoyed every part , bowling , gaming , pools and lots of ice cream. The kids club was very well thought.

My two children are very safe around the hotel and pool area. The childrens club has something for kids of all ages & the hotel is right on the beach too. Traveling with two children, we opted for the Duplex Suite, a two-story haven that exceeded our expectations. While our visit was during the winter, we could appreciate the potential of the hotel's outdoor facilities, including a theater, private beach, and a sizable children's club. It‚Äôs been our first time travelling with a baby and we have appreciated the travel cot, children‚Äôs bedding and baby food available. Plenty for the children . Water park and splash park is very good for our children and us as adults. Yorum: Our stay at Titanic has been amazing, our favourite has been the kids club, they have soo much to do for children. Recommend to all The pools are kept well cleaned, perfect all ages, the children‚Äôs pools are amazing for younger ones, well thought out and safe plus plenty to do for the older ones. This time we took the grandparents as well to take care of our children. The children's playground is being built so there is no chance to let your kid's play outside except of pool and sea (it won't be finished before August 2023 according to staff). The only thing I would say is the location could be slightly better (nearer sandy beaches and nightlife) but everything for the children and had the best holiday here. For families with children it‚Äôs good hotel!!! Kids club is amazing all the staff are very good with children!! We come again with our children next month, definitely! Children facilities are amazing, so much for my son to do. Excellent for children, especially around the pool and Ali who gets your drinks! Yorum: SAFETY AT THIS HOTEL IS AN ISSUE SEE THE PICTURES Food is brilliant, pools are great and the entertainment is some of the best I have seen, however some of the staff are rude and we have been on the end of a personal attack regarding our children. Majority of staff are great but in hospitality you can't go slagging children off because of the speed of throwing a bowling ball.

There are also multiple outdoor swimming pools, water slides and a water park for all the ages to maximise the fun element. Yorum: Great hotel for families, the splash pad and slides are great.

If the splash pool has heated it would be amazing and if the sunbed were made clear that they can't be reserved it would help. Yorum: Great hotel for families, the splash pad and slides are great.

Yorum: Had a lovely chilled out week pity it rained most of the time 3 days of sun but luckily hotel had lots to do played pool chilled out in the spa also lovely heated outdoor pool. maybe a little tired, pools very good and lots of areas to relax, food is ok .. As a toddler it was brilliant that we had a splash pool and the kids club was superb! If the splash pool has heated it would be amazing and if the sunbed were made clear that they can't be reserved it would help. With multiple large pools, restaurants, buffets and cafes, this is easily up there with some of the top resorts that I've stayed at. There is so much choice in regard to pool area and beach area we didn‚Äôt wait for anything. There were many outdoor pools to choose from, but our favourite days were spent in the cabanas on the beach front where the service was also fantastic. On of the pool outside is heated and it's nice to go for a swim when it's a little bit chill outside. Generally really clean but some drainage problems around the pool areas which cause large puddles making things really slippy and at times it can smell.

Clean rooms, with spacious balconies ( balcony doors are hard to open, women with long nails will understand:) Several pools with different depths. Lots of fun, amazing food, lots of entertainment but not overwhelming, lots of bars, nice pools, beautiful beach, nice and friendly stuff, minibar in the room. When situation the pool the waiters who on roller blades are quick and efficient and again nothing is too much trouble. Lots of pools and plenty of beds but you need to reserve early in the morning. Yorum: We are on our last day here but have had such a wonderful time here, the bar staff Ali on roller skates at the pool was so attentive! The evening entertainment has been fabulous and our son had loved the water slides and pools during the day. My two children are very safe around the hotel and pool area. Around the pool is very clean with the staff at the aqua bar never letting your drinks be empty. We really enjoy swimming in the pool and enjoying the warm sun. The staff members within the hotel as well as by the pool ( serving drinks; Alperen) have been extraordinary! Only small complaint I would have is trying to get a bed by the pools. Pool - staff are incredible, nothing is too much for them to do. We stayed around the Olympic pool majority of our stay and the pool guys on skates were absolutely fabulous. The hotel's extensive facilities, including the spa, pools, and entertainment options, ensured there was never a dull moment.

Sunbeds are busy but plenty of them, as with all hotels if you want a specific spot for instance round kids pool or right beside pool you will need to be up early before 8am to put a towel down.

Recommend to all The pools are kept well cleaned, perfect all ages, the children‚Äôs pools are amazing for younger ones, well thought out and safe plus plenty to do for the older ones. I found the rooms to be very spacious and always kept clean, the pools were also very clean and sanitary. The service around the pool is outstanding with the waiters on roller skates.

The pool is nice and hitting!! Love the waiters on roller skates around the pool. So much to do at the hotel with choices of pools and beach. Friendly personel, especially near the pool. Whether on the beach or round the pool there is alway a bar or waiter service, with drinks served by glass or beer in the bottles (Efes). Pools are great would definitely come back for another holiday 155. The resort also has a bowling and pool area, tennis and basketball court, football field and kids park. There are also multiple outdoor swimming pools, water slides and a water park for all the ages to maximise the fun element. But I personally like the indoor pool as it‚Äôs temperature maintained and allow through access to gym, sauna, steam and shower room and there is also a Turkish bath !

You could see in the kitchen area the guy who was making the kebabs was cleaning his sweat with bare hand and then touching the food to serve!!! The beach was never cleaned! Room was very clean and tidy. Cleanliness was above expectation very good hotel will defiantly be coming back. Our room is always so clean and mini bar stocked up.

To back up a wee note to ensure we were on the right bus, etc. A little busy on an evening which was to over whelming at 8pm . The hotel was great in terms of location, clean, it offered both quiet and more busy areas to rest and sunbathe. The weather was great it was not too busy which we loved. Sunbeds are busy but plenty of them, as with all hotels if you want a specific spot for instance round kids pool or right beside pool you will need to be up early before 8am to put a towel down. Yorum: Outstanding beautiful food excellent spoiled for choice lots of options very busy but staff an food plentiful an friendly place cool pools nr beach an bar events an cocktails stunning gardens an amazing place to enjoy an stay hard working staff clean and tidy shops in side an out lots of excursions to do visit harbour get a boat trip very picturesque destination beach nice too an even better further up indoor pool fab too sauna an spa a must just try them excursions for shopping at mall great too weather not bad at all warm enough an pleasant 124. And everything you ask the response is either they are busy or They are in the winter concept which contradicts being busy! Yorum: The Titanic Deluxe was absolutely stunning, the hotel even while at full capacity did not feel crowded or too busy. Beachfront location with an excellent equipped kids play area inside and out. Yorum: Beautiful location, very close to the beach and we had lovely views from our seaside room, rooms are very spacious and clean. The hotel was great in terms of location, clean, it offered both quiet and more busy areas to rest and sunbathe. Location is great, it‚Äôs close to shops. The only thing I would say is the location could be slightly better (nearer sandy beaches and nightlife) but everything for the children and had the best holiday here. The location the staff the weather is all superb. Lovely staff and a great location. Hotel has good location easily accessible beech. Yorum: Lovely hotel and great location. Everything you could possibly need is in the hotel and other shops are walking distance. Only criticisms are the air condition is controlled centrally so you cannot control it yourself and usual problem of people reserving sunbeds with towels but not using them until hours later. Everything you could possibly need is in the hotel and other shops are walking distance. The view from our room was superb - pretty much overlooking the entire complex and surrounding areas. Beachfront location with an excellent equipped kids play area inside and out. Soft play, PlayStation room, lego room, face painting, sleeping area with cots/junior beds and staff very helpful. maybe a little tired, pools very good and lots of areas to relax, food is ok .. The room shows its age in certain areas, like taps are a bit tired, the carpets have stains on it from spilt beverages I assume. The swimming area is clean and with lots to do. There is so much choice in regard to pool area and beach area we didn‚Äôt wait for anything. Generally really clean but some drainage problems around the pool areas which cause large puddles making things really slippy and at times it can smell. Pool area and water park fab! Our agent gave us this information in advance, stating that it is an affordable hotel, but most of the winter concept and outdoor areas are closed. My two children are very safe around the hotel and pool area. The hotel was great in terms of location, clean, it offered both quiet and more busy areas to rest and sunbathe. We didn't get a chance to experience the kids play area as it's currently unde construction but it looks like it'll be a really good play park. Additions of pattiserie, fruit bar, jacket potatos and waffle and ice cream bars beside pool area is excellent. Bars have good selection of branded drinks and good choice of cocktails, this year u you also get bottled beers round the pool area, pool service is great very attentive roller blading waiters. Pool area is excellent along with water slides for all ages. Pier and beach area is good but since renovations there is now nowhere to jump of pier unless you book a cabana which is a shame as last year we spent alot of time on pier jumping off. Just disappointing that you pay full price when only half of the area is available. We loved the outside hotel area!!!! My kids loved the Kikoa Club as they used to go there everyday for 3 hours, it includes many activities for all ages but my kids opted for soft play area as well as play station room. The resort also has a bowling and pool area, tennis and basketball court, football field and kids park. All food & drink is to a really high standard in the main buffet restaurant and bar areas. The lighting system in the family area is broken and every other bulb works. You could see in the kitchen area the guy who was making the kebabs was cleaning his sweat with bare hand and then touching the food to serve!!! I also loved the fact that there were not too many people around, which meant that the place had a calm and peaceful effect. truthfully it's slightly dated in places but still a lovely place to stay never the less. Great place and would highly recommend it. Yorum: The hotel has been amazing the place is beautiful and clean.

Place very clean staff lovely. Moreover, their attention to detail is commendable, the resort is always kept in an immaculate condition, the cleaning crew and domestic staff are working throughout the day to keep the place spotless. There are also plenty of places to eat/drink/buy etc. We would definitely come back again to Titanic Resort as we believe it‚Äôs a perfect place for a family holiday ! If you have read this review and it was helpful to you, please make sure you like it, so more people can be aware and stay away from this place! Our third time and it just keeps getting better and better especially with all the new improvement it‚Äôs just the best place to visit we love it.

You're literally a 5min walk from your room to the beach. Staff are friendly and attentive, beach towels and beds freely available. We received prompt service every time we visited the main restaurant, lobby bar or snack bar by the beach. There is so much choice in regard to pool area and beach area we didn‚Äôt wait for anything. Yorum: Beautiful location, very close to the beach and we had lovely views from our seaside room, rooms are very spacious and clean. Yorum: This was our first visit to Turkey üáπüá∑ and will definitely not be our last @Titanic deluxe lara beach. There were many outdoor pools to choose from, but our favourite days were spent in the cabanas on the beach front where the service was also fantastic. Beach has so many sun beds and bars and restaurants to eat. Good slides and a day at the beach on a cabana was the icing on the cake. The beach is really good with plenty of beds for everyone. We booked cabanas by the beach, lots of space, excellent service, with fruit platters, lunch w5c brought to you. Lots of fun, amazing food, lots of entertainment but not overwhelming, lots of bars, nice pools, beautiful beach, nice and friendly stuff, minibar in the room. Yorum: The hotel was great it had a very nice view, the beach is very clean and the cabana service was exceptional. I have been to most hotels on lara beach. The childrens club has something for kids of all ages & the hotel is right on the beach too. The beach side is also lovely. There is bar near the beach so you can order anything. The restaurants on the beach are amazing. While our visit was during the winter, we could appreciate the potential of the hotel's outdoor facilities, including a theater, private beach, and a sizable children's club. Beach cabanas are the best and great views with private staff on hand. The Beach bar Ahmed!! Right on the beach. We spent one day at one of the beach cabanas this is definitely worth the money. The beach cabana is gorgeous, with lovely service. The swimming pools were clean and the service on the beach were amazing!!! Pier and beach area is good but since renovations there is now nowhere to jump of pier unless you book a cabana which is a shame as last year we spent alot of time on pier jumping off. Yorum: The reason for only 4 stars is that this is a smoking hotel, so all the outside spaces, poolside, restaurants, beaches etc are open for smokers which, as a non smoker, was off-putting. We especially enjoyed the lunch restaurants near to the beach. The hotel staff are wonderful, the beach is lovely and entire experience is 100%. The beach is just luxurious with some cabanas which can be rented for the day, these also have fantastic service, where food and drink is always available and offered. Some of the new beds on the beach are broken. The only thing I would say is the location could be slightly better (nearer sandy beaches and nightlife) but everything for the children and had the best holiday here.

The service is on par with the Max Royal (which costs 5 x the amount) The food has a good variety and the A la Carte restaurants at the beach for lunch are amazing. The beach was very clean and the cabana‚Äôs were clean and beautiful to stay in. Love that they have beach front restaurants for snacks that serve freshly cooked food to order like pizzas, pasta etc. The decking over the beach is excellent with lots of seating and a bar. So much to do at the hotel with choices of pools and beach. We spent 3 days on the cabanas at the beach and Mustafa was amazing and made sure we had everything we needed. The Beach is clean and beds are well prepared with towels every morning. Whether on the beach or round the pool there is alway a bar or waiter service, with drinks served by glass or beer in the bottles (Efes). Beach beds & beach staff work hard to make our holiday oerfect. Yorum: We booked Titanic Resort at Lara Beach for one week commencing from 01 Nov 2023 and we have had one of the best time there. It has everything for every age‚Ä¶Food, drinks, pools, beach, great staff, activities. Loved the exercise classes near the beach, with a great sea view and sea breeze. I got bitten by a fish on my both feet when swimming in the sea of the Hotel‚Äôs beach, which made an awful pain and bleeding, i asked for a doctor to have it checked, they sent a nurse who had no gloves on when treating me, dangerous for her and me! The beach was never cleaned! The only thing I would say is the location could be slightly better (nearer sandy beaches and nightlife) but everything for the children and had the best holiday here. Yorum: Beautiful location, very close to the beach and we had lovely views from our seaside room, rooms are very spacious and clean. The nighttime entertainment was amazing, and we were there for the last white party of the season and many other themed nights. Yorum: We booked for two weeks through the hotel , we had asked all about entertainment for Halloween, was never told about out of season , that everything would be shut the second week. Food is extremely bad , fruit is non existent off season. would recommend in season and definitely not off season . Of course there is access to the sea. When we first arrived we were facing the sea and delivery bay but we‚Äôre moved the next day after speaking to reception. The expansive property dazzled with enchanting lights and beautifully adorned Christmas trees, creating a festive ambiance that complemented the joy of the season. Direct ladder into the sea. Yorum: As a dual citizen of Turkey but live in Australia and a well seasoned traveller, this has to be one of the best hotels we have stayed in for a long time! The children's playground is being built so there is no chance to let your kid's play outside except of pool and sea (it won't be finished before August 2023 according to staff). The decking over the beach is excellent with lots of seating and a bar. We did travel out of season (Nov/Dec) so need to bear in mind most facilities are shut and weather is hit miss but that‚Äôs understandable. Please increase your seafood levels like grilled shrimp or sea bass. Loved the exercise classes near the beach, with a great sea view and sea breeze. I got bitten by a fish on my both feet when swimming in the sea of the Hotel‚Äôs beach, which made an awful pain and bleeding, i asked for a doctor to have it checked, they sent a nurse who had no gloves on when treating me, dangerous for her and me!

Yorum: We recently enjoyed a delightful weekend stay at Titanic Deluxe Hotel Lara in Antalya, and overall, our experience was filled with festive cheer and family fun. The Duplex Suite featured a private terrace and jacuzzi, providing a luxurious and comfortable space for our family of four. The indoor pool water was surprisingly cold, and the presence of groups of adult males playing with a ball detracted from the family-friendly atmosphere. Great for the whole family with plenty for the kids to keep them entertained 82.

Yorum: We came for a week in august with family and had a great time. We would definitely come back again to Titanic Resort as we believe it‚Äôs a perfect place for a family holiday ! The lighting system in the family area is broken and every other bulb works. We came to this Hotel with Family 20 times and everything is great. Ther was activities such as soft play, face painting, baby room and more. The lady at the guest relations has been very helpful in sorting out food for our 2 yr old baby.

My two children are very safe around the hotel and pool area. The childrens club has something for kids of all ages & the hotel is right on the beach too. Traveling with two children, we opted for the Duplex Suite, a two-story haven that exceeded our expectations.

It‚Äôs been our first time travelling with a baby and we have appreciated the travel cot, children‚Äôs bedding and baby food available. Plenty for the children . Water park and splash park is very good for our children and us as adults. Yorum: Our stay at Titanic has been amazing, our favourite has been the kids club, they have soo much to do for children. Recommend to all The pools are kept well cleaned, perfect all ages, the children‚Äôs pools are amazing for younger ones, well thought out and safe plus plenty to do for the older ones. This time we took the grandparents as well to take care of our children. The children's playground is being built so there is no chance to let your kid's play outside except of pool and sea (it won't be finished before August 2023 according to staff). The only thing I would say is the location could be slightly better (nearer sandy beaches and nightlife) but everything for the children and had the best holiday here. For families with children it‚Äôs good hotel!!! Kids club is amazing all the staff are very good with children!! We come again with our children next month, definitely! Children facilities are amazing, so much for my son to do. Excellent for children, especially around the pool and Ali who gets your drinks! Yorum: SAFETY AT THIS HOTEL IS AN ISSUE SEE THE PICTURES Food is brilliant, pools are great and the entertainment is some of the best I have seen, however some of the staff are rude and we have been on the end of a personal attack regarding our children. Majority of staff are great but in hospitality you can't go slagging children off because of the speed of throwing a bowling ball.
