Hizmet Kalitesi i√ßin t√ºm sonu√ßlar metni: The service was terrible, the staff was rude and uncaring. I disagree with other guests' impressions that the staff was unfriendly. My wife Lyndsay and I have been there 10 times and the staff are amazing, B√úLENT has to be mentioned, nothing is too much trouble for anyone there... My baby and I were exhausted and when I asked the staff why it was taking so long they gave me vague excuses like the room wasn't ready or there were technical issues. Throughout this ordeal the staff have been condescending, unhelpful and downright rude. From the moment I arrived the staff displayed an appalling lack of professionalism and courtesy. When I brought this to the attention of the staff, they assured me that they would move me to a better room the next day. Instead of resolving issues the staff was condescending and rude. Poor service, dishonest staff and complete lack of care for their guests made this an incredibly disappointing experience. Each staff member has their own rules and one says he can't call a taxi while the other says he can come and get a taxi whenever he wants during his shift. Unwelcoming staff who speak rudely. I personally found my room open and the staff refused to even check the camera footage to see who entered. Comment: Very kind staff. Comment: Fantastic I definitely recommend it the staff was amazing especially Guzra from the front helped us a lot the rooftop view was amazing I recommend going there I went with my family Annnd location I recommend this place even just for its location 12. Friendly staff. Comment: Service staff is very nice and friendly, especially the service! The staff Samet and Fevzi are very kind and friendly. Comment: Very good hotel experience, highly recommended, super welcoming staff, close to everything, nothing to say, no negative points 20. The staff has an arrogant attitude and the whole thing was a nightmare. The staff is generally cold, but Samet and ≈ûehmus' attention, smiling faces and kind behavior made us feel more comfortable at the hotel. The staff was friendly and the bathrooms were very luxurious and clean. The staff were helpful from day one, breakfast was very varied, we had half board so dinner was a set menu but there was an option to order something different and pay for the meal, the terrace pool has a nice view of the marina but the pools are small and not ideal for children, the jacuzzi was good but the water was not hot, the sauna was good, I would definitely recommend the Turkish bath in the hotel, it was very good. Use the local Istanbul card to travel as it works on If you have any issues while you are at the hotel, speak to the staff as everything is negotiable. Comment: Good location but tourist trap staff, very small rooms for the price and a dirty/poorly maintained swimming pool for ¬£40. Otherwise the staff was good. Staff service and everything else in the hotel was very good. Comment: I do not recommend this hotel, the staff is unpleasant, the rooms are very small, not very clean and the worst part is the swimming pool which closes at 18:00 due to the disgust of the receptionist's behavior. Comment: Definitely the best hotel I have ever stayed in, I felt really welcomed here and well received by the staff. The night staff working were very kind, I have never felt like this before but they are a really good group and very good service. The night staff working at the reception are Samet and the old man. Definitely something I will book here for the night staff only thing working next time! It was very comfortable and pleasant to be there, the staff was very attentive and polite, always ready to help. Everything is perfect and the staff is very friendly... Comment: A great hotel, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly, the rooms are quite good and the breakfast buffet is very diverse, it is also very close to the metro station, buses, the Bosphorus, and also close to Sultanahmet and Laleli by tram. We were on the first floor, no bedbugs, rooms very nice, cleaned every day, attentive staff, very friendly. Comment: Location is perfect, close to services and breakfast service is excellent Staff is great and friendly, but the downside is that the rooms are very small like other rooms in Istanbul. The staff is very friendly and whatever... And finally the hotel was invaded by THORACIES without any reaction from the staff. Beyond friendly staff, clean rooms and a delicious breakfast. When I brought this discrepancy to the attention of your staff and showed them the confirmation email with screenshots clearly stating the details of my reservation, I was met with an uncaring response claiming that the hotel had sold out of the specified room type. Instead of immediately addressing our concerns and offering a proper solution, your staff reluctantly gave us keys to two separate rooms after I insisted on compensation. I must also express my disappointment with the unprofessional behavior of your staff, especially their attempt to discourage guests from sharing their honest feedback through reviews. Friendly reception staff, on the other hand 3. No one on staff speaks Spanish and sometimes they are unwilling to explain themselves in English either. Pretty pleasant staff. Attentive and available staff. The staff is friendly. Comment: The service was very kind, the staff was always friendly and helpful. Comment: The service was very kind, the staff was always friendly and helpful. The staff is very kind and thoughtful. The staff are extremely kind and helpful, making you feel welcome from start to finish. The reception staff was unpleasant as if we were staying for free, they left one slipper in the room, I went to ask for a second pair of slippers if possible and a pair for my husband, as if I asked them to take it. The staff were very welcoming, the room was large and comfortable, and the breakfast had many options. Everything is clean and the staff is super professional. The staff is very friendly, I definitely recommend it. Comment: Location close to everything, clean, comfortable, great staff. Even if you had a problem, it was resolved in a very short time thanks to the extremely friendly staff. The staff is confused and doesn't know how to help you. The cleaning staff used my credit card and tried to withdraw all my money from my bank account. Review: Super great hotel, very clean and staff very friendly.......‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏è‚ù£Ô∏èüëåüëåüëå 118. Comment: Clean hotel, friendly staff, very good breakfast, good value for money, perfect location to visit touristic places by tram or walking with Marmaray, I am happy with my stay and will return to this hotel without hesitation. Even though I never agreed to pay extra, I found myself paying this amount because the staff could not find any solution. When I informed the staff about the situation, they said there was nothing they could do and that the person with motor impairment had to climb 6 floors because no other solution could be found. When I notified the staff they said everyone in the hotel had their water cut off and they couldn't do anything. When I asked the staff to call a manager I was denied and told the manager was not there. And finally, when I asked for an invoice at the hotel as proof that I had paid the taxi fare in advance, the staff rejected it. Comment: Recently renovated hotel only superficially as many rooms remain neglected, showers, walls, old furniture, a lot of rust everywhere, silicone shower fungus, friendly staff 133. Comment: Terrible staff, windowless room, parking in the mud for a special fee, gym is good but only in the picture. From the staff only the manager, the chef, the butler in the "spa" are good, the rest are disaster, rude! Comment: Very poor in terms of staff, bad attitudes, small rooms, very poor lighting. Comment: Everything is clean and tidy I didn't like the variety in the breakfast very much The staff is very respectful and kind Especially SEYHMUS and SAMET The rooms are a bit small My reservation was 14 square meters Those who book for two people, not more than 146. Comment: The hotel is good, the location is close to the metro (1-2 minutes walk) and the staff - 151. Comment: The hotel is good, the location is close to the metro (1-2 minutes walk) and the staff - 152. I did not expect this hotel management and staff to open the room outside of the usual morning cleaning time with such rude attitude. The hotel looks nice and luxurious but the name is the staff! Numerous arguments between guests and staff were seen getting violent at the hotel. Comment: The hotel is nice, the staff are friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and nice but the room I stayed in was a bit tight for three people. Nice hotel rooms and staff. Comment: The staff here is rude. The hotel staff is very hospitable, I cannot understand how this hotel got 4 stars. When we arrived we were greeted by very friendly staff, who took our luggage and carried it to our room. During our lunch the staff changed and we had to re-explain that the meal was included in the full board.¬≤ Instead of a normal sized pool on the terrace there was a splash pool surrounded by tables and people smoking. The staff are friendly and professional, but they don't always speak English. The view from our rooms wasn't great so if needed talk to the staff to get moved. Comment: Very attentive staff. The hotel is spotlessly clean, the staff is friendly, the rooms and bathrooms are sparkling clean, our beds and pillows are spotlessly clean and do not smell, the breakfast is clean and delicious. The staff at the reception were very rude and intimidating, especially two people like Yasin and Charmane who lied to us multiple times about being managers when I asked to speak to a manager. Comment: Staff is not friendly. Comment: Breakfast was excellent, staff very friendly, we requested a free room upgrade. Wonderful and welcoming staff, most professional and attentive. Breakfast is very poor, with little variety and staff that doesn't really care about the room. They need to work on customer service, especially communication. Friendly staff. Beyond friendly staff, clean rooms and a delicious breakfast. Even if you had a problem, it was resolved in a very short time thanks to the extremely friendly staff.

Comment: One of the worst hotels They don't give water bottles, you have to pay for water The receptionist is not helpful at all and rude My room was 109 It should only be rated with 2 stars The room is small and expensive In front of me some gave very high prices, some gave less because they made their reservations from a tourism company.

Comment: Very good service Clean rooms 14. Comment: Service staff is very nice and friendly, especially the service! But there is a big BUT The service is generally zero, we bought the tour through a tour operator, we paid everything 2 months in advance, we confirmed it for 3 adults. The service is good. They need to work on customer service, especially communication. Comment: Location is good, service is very average... Comment: Rooms are not serviced and that is not the best thing. Staff service and everything else in the hotel was very good. Only give 4 stars for services. The night staff working were very kind, I have never felt like this before but they are a really good group and very good service. The condition of the hotel/triple room was not very good, but reaching the hotel and being greeted with such a good and positive service was very good for me and made me feel at home. Comment: I am writing to state that I was extremely dissatisfied with the service I received during my previous stay at Orka Royal, I had 2 interconnected rooms, one had cockroaches and when we went for breakfast there were hairs in the tomatoes 5 times.

Room service was daily and they did a great job. The service was very bad. It is offered as expensive and exclusive with spa and special services. I expressed my concerns and was not satisfied with the service I received.

Comment: Close to public transport and above all a good hotel. Each staff member has their own rules and one says he can't call a taxi while the other says he can come and get a taxi whenever he wants during his shift. In particular, there was a young man originally from Urfa who was present at breakfast and another employee originally from Mardin who accompanied us to the taxi on the day of departure. I was disappointed as I couldn't find the person there and had to take another taxi which asked me to pay an additional fee. And finally, when I asked for an invoice at the hotel as proof that I had paid the taxi fare in advance, the staff rejected it. You can order a transfer to any airport at the hotel with the reward you will receive on the street. We requested a car with a driver to go to the airport on the last day. Comment: As a mother traveling with my 1 year old, I expected basic respect and compliance, but instead I was met with lies, abuse, and endless waiting. There was construction going on outside the hotel which was unfortunate but considering the busyness of the area the hotel was surprisingly quiet. Because it is cheap and there are trams, ferries, buses etc. Comment: A great hotel, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly, the rooms are quite good and the breakfast buffet is very diverse, it is also very close to the metro station, buses, the Bosphorus, and also close to Sultanahmet and Laleli by tram. As a visitor to Istanbul I expected to be treated with respect and honesty, however I feel your business is trying to take advantage of tourists by ignoring their confirmed reservations and offering substandard accommodation. Before booking you should check with the hotel manager which rooms are available (Top option = the best; cheaper - only if you are travelling alone or on business = maximum night stay). This makes us wonder about the cleanliness of the business in question. The hotel is located next to food streets, Tram station, port and Train station. Comment: Located opposite the historical Sirkeci train station, which is the destination of the famous Orient Express in Istanbul, this historical station is a must-visit place. Comment: Excellent location, close to train and tram station The ground on the way to reach it is flat The rooms are spacious Breakfast is very diverse and big Room service 7-10 Bathroom is good but ventilation fan is not working 117. The furniture is all old and Attention, they charged 40 euros for parking while the hotel stated 10 euros üí∂(they wanted 40 per day) in the center the lights are often turned off and that was the case, it was impossible to stay in the heat, there was a generator, it was very noisy at night, it was impossible to sleep. The parking situation was a complete joke. Not only was it not free, it involved parking on a ramp of rocks and dust from a collapsed building. The room had the worst view (the parking lot was run down) and the French balcony was... Comment: Terrible staff, windowless room, parking in the mud for a special fee, gym is good but only in the picture. The hotel is modern, quiet, clean and in a great location. Sure the location is nice but you can't sleep at night and I have no idea how they got 4 stars. Comment: The hotel is not bad, in a quiet location, but not worthy of 4 *!||The hotel is in a quiet location, although the central area is noisy, which is a huge plus, then the rooms are very small, there is a strong smell of sewage, which is very bad... - I can't say anything good except that the location is good. Comment: Fantastic I definitely recommend it the staff was amazing especially Guzra from the front helped us a lot the rooftop view was amazing I recommend going there I went with my family Annnd location I recommend this place even just for its location 12. The location of the hotel is good. Comment: Location is great, close to all major attractions Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Grand Bazaar, Restaurants, Shops, Tram Line/Stops and Ports.|The hotel itself was clean and tidy, breakfast was ok but not great and not much more‚Ä¶ 15. Comment: The location is great, close to all major tourist attractions, Blue Mosque, Hagia Sophia, Grand Bazaar, Restaurants, Shops, Tram Lines/Stops and Ports. The location is great, if you like walking you can find places of interest around this hotel. Comment: The hotel stands out with its 2 swimming pools and Turkish bath, good location and wonderful terrace overlooking the Bosphorus. Comment: The location of the hotel is good, but the terrace is not accessible in the evening. Comment: V good location. Comment: The location is great, great for tourism in general, whether you're wandering around the markets or hopping on a boat. Comment: Good location but tourist trap staff, very small rooms for the price and a dirty/poorly maintained swimming pool for ¬£40. Comment: Location is good, service is very average... The location is very good. Comment: Hotel with excellent location, 20 seconds from metro station, many restaurants, tram stop, ferry port, . The location is close to everywhere you can walk... I liked the location, it was close to the Sirkeci tram stop. Comment: I didn't really like the hotel - it seemed to have an ideal location and nice photos on the website, but it turned out that the rooms have poor soundproofing from the street (even with the windows fully closed). Among the advantages is the location - not far from there is the Marmaray station, a little further there are piers from which you can swim in the Bosphorus. Comment: Location is perfect, close to services and breakfast service is excellent Staff is great and friendly, but the downside is that the rooms are very small like other rooms in Istanbul. Only the location is great because it is close to Hagia Sophia, Sultanahmet Mosque and Sultanahmet Mosque. The location is perfect, you can walk to the top of Zlatni Rog and the tram station is 150 meters away. The location of the hotel is ideal. Comment: Only the location is good. Perfect location in the heart of Istanbul, away from the noise. I would recommend it if the location and there are no other options. Very friendly hotel, good location and a very pleasant and varied breakfast. Comment: Good location, good beds 83. Comment: Excellent location, good value for money 86. Comment: Location is great, breakfast is huge and extremely good quality, view is not that good, at least on the lower floors. The hotel's excellent location close to historical sites makes sightseeing a breeze. Comment: A good hotel in a very good location, very bad terrace, outdoor swimming pool and hammam were not in service. Comment: Very clean, friendly personal, good breakfast and fantastic location, very central. Comment: Room is good Poor breakfast Very good location 95. Comment: Location close to everything, clean, comfortable, great staff. Comment: The location is perfect, there were problems with room cleaning (they forgot to change the towels, change the teacups, change the bedspread), the breakfast is not very good, although it is diverse, there are really too many cheeses and sauces... Comment: Its main feature is the most convenient location to visit the whole of old Istanbul (Topkapi, Hagia Sophia, Sultanahmet Mosque, cistern, bazaar etc.) on foot. The only thing that saves this hotel is its location, but everything else doesn't make up for its shortcomings. Comment: The hotel has a very good location, close to everywhere on foot (Hagia Sophia, Sultanahmet Mosque etc.). Comment: The hotel is in a great location for getting around, the rooms are clean but you can hear all the noise from other rooms, they are not isolated at all. Comment: The location is good, 10 minutes walking distance to the Sultanahmet Mosque, 10 minutes by tram to the Galata Tower, there are 2 tram stops 3 minutes from the hotel. The location is perfect!

Given the unsatisfactory accommodation provided and the inconvenience caused to myself and my friends, I requested a refund so that we could seek alternative accommodation nearby. There are bars and fast food outlets nearby.

There was construction going on outside the hotel which was unfortunate but considering the busyness of the area the hotel was surprisingly quiet. The area around the hotel was nothing like the pictures on the internet; it was dirty, unsafe and absolutely disgusting. There are cats around the kitchen dining area which is beyond unhealthy.

I would love to visit this place again. Comment: Clean hotel, friendly staff, very good breakfast, good value for money, perfect location to visit touristic places by tram or walking with Marmaray, I am happy with my stay and will return to this hotel without hesitation. We highly recommend this place and will definitely be back! They cannot replace shampoos, toilet paper and tea. We left because of the unhygienic conditions, the place was really too dirty for us, we did not receive compensation and therefore we paid for the nights we did not stay there. When I compare it to other places, the location is very good, it is very close to Topkapi, Gulhane, Ayasofya, Sultan Ahmet and Zemin Batan Cistern.
