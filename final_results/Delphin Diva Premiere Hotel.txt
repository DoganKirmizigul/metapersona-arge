You could easily stay at the resort as it has everything covered, activities for the kids, lots of pools, water slides, a private beach, several à la carte restaurants, plus… 7. - Meanwhile, our children went swimming and used the slides. When we got to the slides, there was a lady who was paying attention. Suddenly she disappeared and all the children had to go and see for themselves if they could get on the slide (because of the children who were sliding and had a safe path so they wouldn't collide). I have a 9 and 13 year old son and I trust that there will be supervision on the slides. The hotel also has a large central pool where various games and entertainment are held, there is a pool with slides for children and a separate pool in a quiet area for those who want peace and quiet. For families, there is a pleasant atmosphere and many swimming pools and slides, as well as bars and restaurants of various types, and of course, entertainment and a children's playground and club. The pool area was huge and invited you to relax while the kids had fun on the slides. A large main pool, a pool with several water slides or an adults-only “relaxation pool”. The main pool is good, not the biggest in Lara, the water slides here are mainly for under 8s. Very well organized children's area: children's pools, small slides, playground, amusement park, children's dishes in the restaurant. Many different pools (with recreation, adult pool, children's pool, pool with 4 slides and of course the sea with a pier right in front of the door. Lots of pools Water slides for younger kids and older kids/adults Beautiful beach. Indoor pool, large outdoor pool, plus a pool with water slides and two additional heated pools. But there's something wrong The tiles around the pool slide brutally 117. Only the poolside activities were few. There is programming at the central pool, there is always some kind of movement / I really liked the theater, we went with pleasure. You could easily stay at the resort as it has everything covered, activities for the kids, lots of pools, water slides, a private beach, several à la carte restaurants, plus… 7. Darts in the morning, no place in the pools, (reserved) towels everywhere and the sun loungers are empty. Yorum: This was our first time at a Delphin hotel and our standards are now higher 😂|A very nice place, friendly staff, my son loved the skaters in the pool.|It is very clean, spacious, there were sun loungers… 10. They come to the pool with coffee carts and ice cream bikes and they come to carry their drinks on roller skates. The only thing we vacationers didn't like was that every day there was an event with music at the hotel by the pool, right in front of all the windows overlooking the sea, until 11pm and at the neighboring hotel there. The service at the pool bar was attentive. Well-arranged pools. The hotel also has a large central pool where various games and entertainment are held, there is a pool with slides for children and a separate pool in a quiet area for those who want peace and quiet. Every night there is a show in the amphitheater, live music by the pool. As anywhere else, the pool and beach loungers are always reserved quickly, but luckily we also have an early bird = sunbed reservist with us 😉. There is always a good atmosphere at the pool. Relaxing pool. For families, there is a pleasant atmosphere and many swimming pools and slides, as well as bars and restaurants of various types, and of course, entertainment and a children's playground and club. - almost every day there is something to do (Candyland, pool party, ...) - there are food stalls all day long (kebab, fries, waffles, Ola ice cream, ...) So for us the disadvantages : - on the first day we arrived (8pm) the sofa bed for the youngest children had not yet been made. - customer service walked around the pool to see if there were any complaints and asked if we could speak German. In the pool there seem to be real territorial wars over the sun loungers, although the pool seems to be 35 degrees hot, and in the sea there are always places on the beach, which was great. The food, cleanliness and service at the meal and pool were indescribably good. There are enough sun loungers at the pool and by the sea, no need to make a reservation. Every night there is an event at the pool, which almost always runs from 9pm to midnight. In the children's pool, Özge and Mehmet made sure that all the children felt safe and comfortable. At the pool you were looked after by the skate team without ever being intrusive. It didn't matter if it was at the reception, the restaurant or the pool – we were well looked after everywhere. The pool area was huge and invited you to relax while the kids had fun on the slides. Be it the food, the beach, the pools, the room or the service. Swimming pools: There are different swimming pools. A large main pool, a pool with several water slides or an adults-only “relaxation pool”. In each pool you will be accompanied by a team of inline skaters. Our only problem was that as the weather was very hot, the sea and pool water were also very hot. Yeşim, who sincerely helped us during the reservation and talked about the hotel for minutes, to the waiters at the pool bar, main restaurant and lobby who came to us with a smile as soon as we sat down at the table, to the skating service staff and lifeguard friends who were always smiling and courteous despite working in the heat in the relaxation pool. The shows, the DJs and even the water sports at the main pool were all in German. The main pool is good, not the biggest in Lara, the water slides here are mainly for under 8s. The pool skate team was always present and you never had to wait long for your drinks. It doesn't matter if it's a restaurant, lobby or pool. Pool area: very good. You can always find free spaces both at the pool and on the beach. Lots of activities, pools, food, drinks and fun. At the children's pool, the waiter on roller skates is super attentive. The music by the pool at night wasn't my thing. Very well organized children's area: children's pools, small slides, playground, amusement park, children's dishes in the restaurant. One suggestion: there is a LOT of noise in the rooms until 11:30pm (music from the pools), it's best to bring earplugs if you want to sleep. Many different pools (with recreation, adult pool, children's pool, pool with 4 slides and of course the sea with a pier right in front of the door. There is a large team of skaters at the various pools, every few minutes they ask if you want something to drink and they almost get sad if you say no. I would like to highlight Jastin from the bar at Relexpool, he spoiled us all day, but our breakfast waiter Mehmet was also great. Lots of pools Water slides for younger kids and older kids/adults Beautiful beach. Yorum: The best hotel I know, I've been here many times and I'm always moved, great hotel, large rooms and fridge always full, including mega buffets, super clean beach and pools, very friendly and helpful staff! Several swimming pools (2 heated + 1 indoor pool) invite you to swim. I would like to highlight the very loud music at night and the sound system at the pool. Indoor pool, large outdoor pool, plus a pool with water slides and two additional heated pools. Service staff on roller skates and an ice cream truck constantly circulated the pool areas and served guests on the lounge chairs whatever they wanted. The very loud music at the night pool parties (until 11pm) was a bit annoying. But there's something wrong The tiles around the pool slide brutally 117. Yorum: We had a lot of fun for a week doing nothing but the pool, beach, eating, resting, repeating with the family. The food is good, great pools and beach. The waiter on roller skates at the bottom of the relaxation pool serves alone and is super fast and friendly, it was his first OK month at the hotel and he comes from Izmir. The live music bands at the pool are only aimed at the older German audience. Fast service and excellent service from the Skate team in the heated pools! Quality corner food and an excellent idea with watermelon and sheep's cheese in the pool! On our last day at the hotel, the pool restaurant, beach bar and many other areas were completely closed. There are no free sun loungers at the children's pool after the early hours of the morning. You could easily stay at the resort as it has everything covered, activities for the kids, lots of pools, water slides, a private beach, several à la carte restaurants, plus… 7. Be sure to bring water shoes. Water at the station in front of the airport costs €6 for half a liter!!! Immediately near our sun loungers there was a cart from 10am where water, iced tea, soft drinks and various beers were available throughout the day. A large main pool, a pool with several water slides or an adults-only “relaxation pool”. Our only problem was that as the weather was very hot, the sea and pool water were also very hot. The shows, the DJs and even the water sports at the main pool were all in German. The main pool is good, not the biggest in Lara, the water slides here are mainly for under 8s. The one thing you definitely need to consider is the prices of water sports. Guests with children should also be aware that other guests will be bothered by the mess if the child spills water on the table and hits the table with the palm of their hand and these parents are still singing to the child. Lots of pools Water slides for younger kids and older kids/adults Beautiful beach. Indoor pool, large outdoor pool, plus a pool with water slides and two additional heated pools.

Yorum: We are currently staying in the Delphin Diva room 1126 (02/07 to 12/07) with 2 adults and 2 children. - almost every day there is something to do (Candyland, pool party, ...) - there are food stalls all day long (kebab, fries, waffles, Ola ice cream, ...) So for us the disadvantages : - on the first day we arrived (8pm) the sofa bed for the youngest children had not yet been made. Yorum: We were there as a family with two children (10) and (6) for 8 days at the end of May. The beach is mostly pebble and enters the sea quite steeply, it does not have a gentle slope, which is essential for small children. You should keep this in mind, especially if you are traveling with small children. In the children's pool, Özge and Mehmet made sure that all the children felt safe and comfortable. The nighttime shows were also a highlight - a great program for both children and adults! There is plenty of programming for children and without boredom. Few offers for children. I definitely do not recommend this hotel, especially for families with children.

They are kind, especially with children!!! You have brought so much joy to our children. Simply warm, great interaction with children and parents. But that's good, it didn't disturb the children while they were sleeping and it's often like that on vacation. The music during the children's entertainment could have been quieter, our children needed ear plugs. Perhaps you should pay attention to the fact that children find this volume somewhat irritating... The hotel is not suitable for families with small children, there are activities until late at night with very loud volume. I do not recommend this hotel if you have small children!!! The room we stayed in was sufficient for 2 adults and 2 children (17 and 13 years old) as a family room. It's a paradise for children. For families with older children this may not be so bad and the evening shows will probably be entertaining. It's too high for small children. Normally you go out at night, but you don't do that with small children and it's very disturbing. The children, in particular, had a great time. She cleaned our room very well every day and left surprises for the children in the form of towel swans and crocodiles. At the children's pool, the waiter on roller skates is super attentive. The children had a great time at Luna Park and as parents we felt safe. He welcomed the children very kindly and always helped them fasten their belts. They are loud and party a lot with the children. The children's disco in the evening is one of the many highlights for children. Very well organized children's area: children's pools, small slides, playground, amusement park, children's dishes in the restaurant. Many different pools (with recreation, adult pool, children's pool, pool with 4 slides and of course the sea with a pier right in front of the door. Guests with children should also be aware that other guests will be bothered by the mess if the child spills water on the table and hits the table with the palm of their hand and these parents are still singing to the child. Do not book with children. An El Dorado for children. Cinema at night, or in the afternoon for children, evening events every day. One of them is intended for children. What should be emphasized is the loving care of children in a separate area of ​​the club, with great play/sports facilities, children's carousel, pirate swing. The children's entertainment team is missing a German or Turkish supervisor. Suitable for children! From children to the elderly, you will feel in good hands. There are no free sun loungers at the children's pool after the early hours of the morning. Since there are so many families with children, I would like to expand.

Even on the way to the beach, you can always snack on ice cream, denor, baked potatoes and much more. The beach is clean and has everything for your comfort. The beach house is a different story - very comfortable and the service is good. You could easily stay at the resort as it has everything covered, activities for the kids, lots of pools, water slides, a private beach, several à la carte restaurants, plus… 7. The beach is sandy, private, very wide and you can always find free sun loungers. As anywhere else, the pool and beach loungers are always reserved quickly, but luckily we also have an early bird = sunbed reservist with us 😉. For 3 out of 7 days our room was not cleaned in a timely manner, so by 1pm when we came back from the beach to get ready for lunch we had no towels; even though we specifically requested cleaning before 12pm after the first incident. The location in Larabeqch is fantastic, but it is not a sandy beach, but a rocky beach. The beachfront bungalows are very well designed. In the pool there seem to be real territorial wars over the sun loungers, although the pool seems to be 35 degrees hot, and in the sea there are always places on the beach, which was great. Even on the beach you can get everything, from drinks, ice cream, etc. on the beach in an intrusive manner and some did not want to take "no" for an answer. The beach is mostly pebble and enters the sea quite steeply, it does not have a gentle slope, which is essential for small children. The hotel's location right in front of the beach and its proximity to the airport are other positive points that made the stay particularly pleasant. The hotel's private beach was clean and well maintained. a very wide choice of dishes that is always revisited Access to the beach is about a hundred meters away and very well maintained!

Yorum: We had a lot of fun for a week doing nothing but the pool, beach, eating, resting, repeating with the family. The food is good, great pools and beach. Yorum: One thing in advance: we travel regularly to Turkey/Lara and so we know many of the hotels here that are directly located on the beach, so we can easily compare the houses with each other. On our last day at the hotel, the pool restaurant, beach bar and many other areas were completely closed. This means you don’t have to reserve a sun lounger on the beach or worry about there being no spaces. The beach is sandy, private, very wide and you can always find free sun loungers. Yorum: I've been next to the Resort Hotel for about 5 days with my parents walking on the sand by the sea, passing by the Delphin Diva Premier. The location in Larabeqch is fantastic, but it is not a sandy beach, but a rocky beach. 😭😱 Go to the hotel taxi service if necessary € 25, but they also ask for € 45-50 😠 A pleasant option for families to spend a holiday by the sea on the sand for normal money 💰 💰 33. You will search in vain for sand, lots of plastic rubbish and even 15-litre gas cylinders floating in the sea. Direct access to the sea with a fine sand beach that is cleaned every morning. The only thing we vacationers didn't like was that every day there was an event with music at the hotel by the pool, right in front of all the windows overlooking the sea, until 11pm and at the neighboring hotel there. The sea is clean, without stones, the entrance to the sea is smooth, easy to enter. We really enjoyed relaxing on the pier, where there is also a bar and many sun loungers, because it is not very hot on the pier, the sea breeze blows and it is convenient to immediately dive into the depths.

There are enough sun loungers at the pool and by the sea, no need to make a reservation. The beach is mostly pebble and enters the sea quite steeply, it does not have a gentle slope, which is essential for small children. As the sea is a little further away, we would not book a sea view again. We were thrilled with the combination of excellent service, good food, countless leisure activities and a fantastic seaside location. Our only problem was that as the weather was very hot, the sea and pool water were also very hot. The sea is close by, there are always sun loungers, the food is great, always seafood, fish, meat, fruit. Yorum: I was there with the family for 2 weeks at the end of July 2024 (2 adults and 2 children) Unfortunately, a tourist drowning at sea on the first day leaves a lot to be desired because there are no qualified personnel! Yorum: We had a wonderful stay at Hotel Delphin Diva and would like to express our sincere thanks to Bektas Bey, Gülsüm Hanim and Birol Bey who made this process seamless for us.

The sea is clean, the beach is beautiful, the food is great, the staff are very polite, it is a quality and comfortable hotel. We also paid for a room with a sea view and got a room on the 2nd floor on the side where the view of the sea through the trees was not good. Although there are all kinds of seasonings to choose from, I can also cook it myself if I need to season everything. You will search in vain for sand, lots of plastic rubbish and even 15-litre gas cylinders floating in the sea. Many different pools (with recreation, adult pool, children's pool, pool with 4 slides and of course the sea with a pier right in front of the door. Direct access to the sea with a fine sand beach that is cleaned every morning. Double room with sea view, in need of some renovations, with shower and minibar always well stocked. We booked a sea view and got a room where you had to hang on the balcony railing to see the sea.

The hotel's location right in front of the beach and its proximity to the airport are other positive points that made the stay particularly pleasant. |The location is also very good, close to airport 73. The hotel was chosen due to the short travel time to the airport. Plus a quick airport transfer. Yorum: Just a short drive (15 minutes) from the airport. But you should be careful when going on excursions, the distances here are quite long and you can spend a lot of time on the bus. The staff are busy chasing customers all day, which is a bit boring. The free daily bus service to Antalya was another great hotel service. The location is also TOP and the service shouldn't make much difference. The location in Larabeqch is fantastic, but it is not a sandy beach, but a rocky beach. The hotel's location right in front of the beach and its proximity to the airport are other positive points that made the stay particularly pleasant. We were thrilled with the combination of excellent service, good food, countless leisure activities and a fantastic seaside location. They put us in a horrible location on our first night, right next to the elevators on the ground floor, which meant hearing the noise of people until 3am. |The location is also very good, close to airport 73. Yorum: First of all, some positive things: the service, location and food are good. The location is very good. Really good service and nice location, for young and old. Yorum: Great location with warm-hearted people you always want to meet next time! But you should be careful when going on excursions, the distances here are quite long and you can spend a lot of time on the bus. Also a good club nearby for younger people (pachaclub) 119. There is programming at the central pool, there is always some kind of movement / I really liked the theater, we went with pleasure. The hotel also has a large central pool where various games and entertainment are held, there is a pool with slides for children and a separate pool in a quiet area for those who want peace and quiet. beverage and bar areas in all areas. In addition to the all-day sound, there are also quiet areas. There are mold stains throughout the lobby near the ventilation areas. The area is spacious but very cozy. The hotel also has a large central pool where various games and entertainment are held, there is a pool with slides for children and a separate pool in a quiet area for those who want peace and quiet. Yorum: The hotel is simply superior in many areas. Yorum: Pros: There is always something to eat or drink, almost 24/7 in different areas of the resort, not just snacks, real food, cocktails, everything you need. All areas of the resort are clean and well maintained. Yorum: Very friendly and motivated staff throughout the hotel and in all areas. The pool area was huge and invited you to relax while the kids had fun on the slides. Wonderful green area, wonderful animation. The sea is clean, the service is excellent, the food is varied, the staff is excellent, the area is compact, everything is conveniently located. The area is within the standard. Pool area: very good. There are enough areas even after 10am. Very well organized children's area: children's pools, small slides, playground, amusement park, children's dishes in the restaurant. The hotel also has a spa area. We were immediately impressed by the entire ambiance, from the lobby to the hotel complex with several restaurants/cafes, the well-kept garden area and the large pier. We immediately noticed the exemplary cleanliness in all internal/external areas and in the sanitary facilities. The service in all areas is of a high standard. Service staff on roller skates and an ice cream truck constantly circulated the pool areas and served guests on the lounge chairs whatever they wanted. What should be emphasized is the loving care of children in a separate area of ​​the club, with great play/sports facilities, children's carousel, pirate swing. On our last day at the hotel, the pool restaurant, beach bar and many other areas were completely closed. Darts in the morning, no place in the pools, (reserved) towels everywhere and the sun loungers are empty. Yorum: This was our first time at a Delphin hotel and our standards are now higher 😂|A very nice place, friendly staff, my son loved the skaters in the pool.|It is very clean, spacious, there were sun loungers… 10. We sat for a long time in a very visible place and he didn't even ask if we wanted something to drink. During the day there are several places besides the main restaurant where you can simply have a snack or even a hearty meal. You can feel in every detail how much emphasis is placed on the well-being factor of the guests. Food in some places in the hotel too. In the pool there seem to be real territorial wars over the sun loungers, although the pool seems to be 35 degrees hot, and in the sea there are always places on the beach, which was great. I can't remember any other place where the staff are so respectful. When I asked the first employee I saw when I entered reception where we could get a snack, the answer was “You don’t need to look for a place to eat, food and drink will find you”. A large number of places to play and relax, all clean and well maintained. Childcare: was very popular Waiter: great Entertainment and evening programming: great shows, great activities But the best place in the hotel is the Iskele Bar. The Swiss ice cream parlor Migros also managed only second place. Quiet place, a little away from the main road. All I can say is: the reserved sun loungers are taken away before 9:30 am (which I think is good) and you always have a place.

Parti Deneyimi için tüm sonuçlar metni: sometimes it was a party until 12:30. - almost every day there is something to do (Candyland, pool party, ...) - there are food stalls all day long (kebab, fries, waffles, Ola ice cream, ...) So for us the disadvantages : - on the first day we arrived (8pm) the sofa bed for the youngest children had not yet been made. They are loud and party a lot with the children. The only thing we vacationers didn't like was that every day there was an event with music at the hotel by the pool, right in front of all the windows overlooking the sea, until 11pm and at the neighboring hotel there. Every night there is a show in the amphitheater, live music by the pool. Extremely loud music plays until 11pm every night. What bothered us a little more was loud music until 1am from all corners, especially from the neighboring hotel. The music during the children's entertainment could have been quieter, our children needed ear plugs. The evening program with regular live music is also ok. Yorum: Although this is a super hotel, the music is very loud at night from 9pm to 11pm. The music by the pool at night wasn't my thing. Unfortunately there is no Turkish music, I would like to hear more of that. Yorum: Great hotel, but the music volume at night is very loud. One suggestion: there is a LOT of noise in the rooms until 11:30pm (music from the pools), it's best to bring earplugs if you want to sleep. I would like to highlight the very loud music at night and the sound system at the pool. The very loud music at the night pool parties (until 11pm) was a bit annoying. Unfortunately, the Imperial plays very loud music until 11:30 pm. The live music bands at the pool are only aimed at the older German audience. There is no Turkish music night. It would be great if Turkish classical music / fasıl was performed at the pier once a week. Overly loud techno music is coming. But: you can expect very loud music all day long, lasting until late at night. Even though we adjusted it to full deflection and 10 degrees, unfortunately there was only a little bit of warm air. The shows, the DJs and even the water sports at the main pool were all in German. Maybe we should think about stopping this type of activity with DJs or renovating the hotel and putting in windows that isolate something!!! Wishes for the organization of a specific celebration (birthday) are helpfully accepted.

Spa and Wellness için tüm sonuçlar metni: Only the spa treatment salespeople can be annoying. The hotel also has a spa area. So we decided to go to the spa for massages. One thing is for sure: on our next visit to Delphin Diva we will give the spa ample space. What bothered us was that some employees were advertising massages, spas, etc. So we decided to go to the spa for massages. We expressed our concern from the beginning that we were afraid that afterwards it would be even worse than before, but we were sure that it would definitely not be worse than before the massages. Unfortunately we paid €375.55 in advance for 3 massages, a manicure and a pedicure. The first massage was bearable for my husband; the masseur knew where it hurt and had the necessary sensitivity. The second massage was performed by a woman of Asian descent. He was exhausted afterwards and definitely didn't want to get a massage a third time. Unfortunately there was no way to get the money back for the third massage; 50 euros would have been enough for us as a sign of goodwill. A large main pool, a pool with several water slides or an adults-only “relaxation pool”. Yeşim, who sincerely helped us during the reservation and talked about the hotel for minutes, to the waiters at the pool bar, main restaurant and lobby who came to us with a smile as soon as we sat down at the table, to the skating service staff and lifeguard friends who were always smiling and courteous despite working in the heat in the relaxation pool. The waiter on roller skates at the bottom of the relaxation pool serves alone and is super fast and friendly, it was his first OK month at the hotel and he comes from Izmir. Yorum: The Delphin Diva is an ideal facility for relaxation. Only the spa treatment salespeople can be annoying. Exception The SPA: Ask about Ali Tekdemir's treatment. It's all fast food, tasteless and with a flavor that is super unhealthy. I have been suffering from all kinds of muscle and weight problems for 14 years and he is the first one who has given me relief through manual therapy and given me the perspective that my complaints can be remedied (compared to many physiotherapists in the Netherlands).

For families with older children this may not be so bad and the evening shows will probably be entertaining. The evening shows were mainly dance shows. Every night there is a show in the amphitheater, live music by the pool. The evening program with regular live music is also ok. The live music bands at the pool are only aimed at the older German audience.

At the children's pool, the waiter on roller skates is super attentive. Very well organized children's area: children's pools, small slides, playground, amusement park, children's dishes in the restaurant. Many different pools (with recreation, adult pool, children's pool, pool with 4 slides and of course the sea with a pier right in front of the door.

The beach is sandy, private, very wide and you can always find free sun loungers. The hotel's private beach was clean and well maintained.

Özel Menü için tüm sonuçlar metni: Yorum: Limited to 3 stars due to the food.||As vegetarians we were limited mainly to breads, pastas, pizzas, potato dishes, salads and fruits. Ex.: “Stuffed eggplant” doesn’t have much meaning; this is a problem, especially for vegetarians. Tip: A green sticker for purely vegetarian dishes would be a good start.
