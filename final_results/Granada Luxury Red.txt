Hizmet Kalitesi i√ßin t√ºm sonu√ßlar metni: All the staff, waiters and bartenders are friendly. Thanks to all the staff for their kind work. The rooms are new, the furniture is new, the lobby is new, the pool is new and everything from sun loungers to towels is new, only the staff is old and experienced and knows how to use this new thing. The staff was friendly, even very helpful. Friendly staff walks around asking what you want, and they don't sit down once. The attention and courtesy of the staff was very good. The service staff is very polite, but without knowledge of English it will be a bit difficult if you have to explain any problems with the number. In general, I recommend the hotel, it is fashionable to even return, the quality of the food, the hotel and the staff are quite decent, they constantly monitor and ask if everything is to your liking. Overall the hotel is trying very hard, the quality work of all the staff is visible. Wherever you were, all the service staff were friendly and attentive. Not replaced and in general there is no feeling of freshness (it seems like a new hotel) The staff is not bad, but no one speaks Russian! The staff is very responsive, helpful, those who make you feel good. We arrived at the hotel at 5am and although our room was not available at that time, the staff immediately gave us wristbands and access to all the hotel facilities. Although the official check-in time was much later, the staff made every effort to accommodate us earlier, and by 10am we had our room. In short, we had a very good experience at Granada Luxury Red, with attentive staff and modern facilities. The atmosphere is relaxed and friendly, and the hotel staff is extremely polite and attentive, always concerned about the well-being of the guests. And the staff are so friendly that they will accommodate all your wishes. 1) On the day of check-in, the reception staff did not speak Russian or English, we had to communicate with gestures, it is good that no emergencies arose and we managed to come to an agreement. It is a new hotel and the repair is fresh and the staff is striving to build a good image. It is a new hotel üëç but it has nothing to do with ,,adult,, lack of atmosphere, fun, food, space, sea with pebbles, the pool is fff busy and you disturb without wanting to, the staff is ok but only Turkish, the management just walks, it is fff cold, without feeling any comfort, soap, shampoo in a terrible bottle, a plus for the fridge, the room is always full, bartenders üí™üç∑, I could only use the sauna, Turkish bath for money? Of the staff, the two gentlemen who run the pool bar during the day and evening are very friendly and competent, and the older gentleman who cleans the pool is also nice. and she took no action, the staff for example only Turkish? weak internet, asylum atmosphere, cold, no flower, arrangements, no music, the evening program mediocre, the lack of mattresses on the sunbeds and squished by the pool, the sea with stones, the restaurant with canteen food, the lack of an a la carte restaurant location, but you pay, plus the drinks per bottle, even though we didn't even have Campari or digestive, sweets, juices, the staff at the bar and the friendly girls, I had no claims, only services included in the priceüòú for 5 * and the price paid I mention that we were with several families and that there were about 20 dissatisfied families in the hotel 21. The staff don't speak English or Russian, even the girls working at the reception couldn't answer the most basic questions. I would advise you to avoid the spa at all costs, the prices are inadequate, the staff are unpleasant, pushy, pull your hand and offer services that do not meet the promises. Among the minuses: there is no ironing, there is no room with a sea view from the standard rooms, the hotel area is quite small and there is no quiet place to relax, there are no embankments or other places to walk, the staff does not speak English or Russian, and there were communication problems. Yorum: After a fantastic stay at Granada Luxury Okurcalar in September 2023, where we were particularly impressed by the excellent service and friendly staff, we decided to give the recently opened Granada Luxury Red a try. The hotel is modern and stylish, but you quickly notice that it is very new: both the building and the staff. Another point is the staff. Overall, the service was not up to the high standard we were used to in Okurcalar - the staff barely noticed the guests. A very nice hotel and very friendly and helpful staff. The hotel staff I have had contact with is a team of very nice people, mostly friendly and dedicated. Yorum: The hotel is not 5*, we were disappointed, it has nothing to do with an "adult" hotel, canteen food, good drinks but few dishes, lack of atmosphere, hospital-like corridors, bar staff and waitresses attentive if you give a tip, program for pensioners in the evening, swimming pool of 1.40, we could not use the Turkish bath and sauna, the man of the spa asked us for money so that we could access hand in hand with the management SHAME has nothing to do with GRANADA hotels 28.

Wherever you were, all the service staff were friendly and attentive. Most of the waiters only speak Turkish, in 10 days we were not asked once at the pool or in the evening if we wanted something to drink - except in the restaurant during dinner, service by waiters was reserved for Eastern European guests, who were then also given beer and drinks were brought to the pool in bottles and glasses, in the evening the same picture. We haven't had guest service for 10 days.

Kumsal i√ßin t√ºm sonu√ßlar metni: It was a comedy when the guest relations manager lady chased sun loungers on the beach with her high heels :), the only shortcoming of the hotel is that it is smaller than other granadas and there is no PIER on the beach, they do not allow the use of the other granada pier right next to it. If next year the beach is renovated, the rocks in the sea are removed and a pier, however small, is built, it will be wonderful. The hotel has a pool bar, a beach bar and a lobby. The hotel's beach area welcomes you with fine sand and a beautiful sea. Lying too close to each other on the beach or by the pool. Beach steep and rocky. There are 3 main bars on the hotel grounds, in the lobby, by the pool and on the beach In the lobby bar 10/10 quality alcohol (imported) At the pool and beach it is local but of quite good quality, there are about 38 types of stills to choose from and they offer draft and bottled beer (Carlsberg, Tuborg) About the food: The food is very tasty, 9/10, in terms of variety 8/10, special thanks for the delicious desserts Pool + beach (The pool is not too big and not deep 1 meter 40 centimeters, open until 7 pm, the water is not chlorinated, it is pleasant to be there. Beach: There are sun loungers, the entrance is sandy, the place was almost always there, but the entrance is quite deep, about 7 meters from the beach, the depth is already 2 meters. Of the munos: There is no area near the hotel, (very small) Actually a hotel, a swimming pool, a beach and a place for evening programs In general this is the main drawback, but even this does not play a big role. The food is delicious, there was a lot of fish, there was seafood, there was a lot of meat, vegetables, salads, exceptional sweets, in general it was beautiful and you can take food to the beach or to your room, which is also very important. are served in glass containers and can also be taken in any desired quantity to your room, on the beach etc. The cuisine is delicious and varied, the environment is clean, you feel safe, the beach is good, free minibar. It is worth mentioning, however, that although the sea is very warm and great for swimming, the beach is rocky, which can be a minor inconvenience for some. Although the hotel has many facilities, it is quite small and there is no outdoor seating except by the pool or on the beach with sun loungers. A big advantage is the location of the hotel, it is on the first line directly on the beach, at the accommodation you get cards that you exchange for beach towels and in the evening you exchange them again. Lunch at the beach bar also includes burgers, kebab meat and pizza every day. The beach is quite small, rocky entrance to the water. Yorum: Regrettable, I have been going to 5* hotels in Turkey for more than 20 years, this one doesn't even have 4*, terrible beach, crowded pool, bad food, sweets ok, bartenders ok, but I didn't find any martini, campers, ... The food in the canteen is tasty and varied, but the beach bar was disappointing, only leftovers are served, after lunch in the canteen you eat waste or find it empty. The beach is small but clean. In the morning, an employee puts towels on the tables between the sunbeds and then asks for money for them, even though it is a shared beach. Of the pluses: purely for relaxation for two, clean sea, comfortable room minus the view and noise outside the window, the beach is right on the hotel grounds. However, there is room for improvement here too, especially at the Beach Bar, which was a bit disappointing. Yorum: A location below expectations is not 5*, I had a missed holiday, the room was ok, the people were ok, the food was pathetic, the mess, the beach was crowded, the sunbeds were terrible, you stood in line to wash your feet in something improvised, the disco in the basement was ok, few drinks, we complained that we were harassed by the spa gentleman for the sauna and the turkish bath, they asked us for money, so we could not benefit from these included services, I liked the hotel theme,,,adult,, not cold, not the atmosphere, small space, lack of activity, atmosphere.. The children relieved themselves directly on the beach at the shoreline. There are many children on the beach in this adults-only hotel. This hotel does not have a private beach - it is public - so there are a lot of strangers among the sun loungers and on the deck chairs. It is clear that all beaches in Turkey do not belong to hotels, but... (and normal hotels organize the area in such a way that strangers do not have the opportunity to go deep into the beach and use the infrastructure, and the guards did not have the opportunity to perform tricks). The hotel's beach area welcomes you with fine sand and a beautiful sea. Beach: There are sun loungers, the entrance is sandy, the place was almost always there, but the entrance is quite deep, about 7 meters from the beach, the depth is already 2 meters. The children relieved themselves directly on the beach at the shoreline. Because the season started late, the events were small and insufficient, but if you went to rest, that's not a problem. If next year the beach is renovated, the rocks in the sea are removed and a pier, however small, is built, it will be wonderful. The fish day was great, everything with seafood is an open buffet and it is all ready for you in a great variety. The hotel's beach area welcomes you with fine sand and a beautiful sea. Too few and uncomfortable outdoor seating options. The food is delicious, there was a lot of fish, there was seafood, there was a lot of meat, vegetables, salads, exceptional sweets, in general it was beautiful and you can take food to the beach or to your room, which is also very important. The pool on the property is very clean, but it was enough for us, the sea is very clean. We enjoyed seafood such as mussels, calamari, grilled dorado and trout, as well as sushi. It is worth mentioning, however, that although the sea is very warm and great for swimming, the beach is rocky, which can be a minor inconvenience for some. Although the hotel has many facilities, it is quite small and there is no outdoor seating except by the pool or on the beach with sun loungers. A hotel by the sea. In our room the shower cabin was very poorly sealed. From the balcony you can partially see the sea. Very tasty and always fresh seafood food was only once steamed squid and once fried shrimp on a bun. It is a new hotel üëç but it has nothing to do with ,,adult,, lack of atmosphere, fun, food, space, sea with pebbles, the pool is fff busy and you disturb without wanting to, the staff is ok but only Turkish, the management just walks, it is fff cold, without feeling any comfort, soap, shampoo in a terrible bottle, a plus for the fridge, the room is always full, bartenders üí™üç∑, I could only use the sauna, Turkish bath for money? weak internet, asylum atmosphere, cold, no flower, arrangements, no music, the evening program mediocre, the lack of mattresses on the sunbeds and squished by the pool, the sea with stones, the restaurant with canteen food, the lack of an a la carte restaurant location, but you pay, plus the drinks per bottle, even though we didn't even have Campari or digestive, sweets, juices, the staff at the bar and the friendly girls, I had no claims, only services included in the priceüòú for 5 * and the price paid I mention that we were with several families and that there were about 20 dissatisfied families in the hotel 21. There was never a shortage of sunbeds, neither by the pool nor by the sea, at any time of the day. Among the minuses: there is no ironing, there is no room with a sea view from the standard rooms, the hotel area is quite small and there is no quiet place to relax, there are no embankments or other places to walk, the staff does not speak English or Russian, and there were communication problems. Of the pluses: purely for relaxation for two, clean sea, comfortable room minus the view and noise outside the window, the beach is right on the hotel grounds. We were especially impressed by the floor-to-ceiling windows, which gave us incredible views of the sea. the sea is clean. Food is a separate problem: you are allergic - you have nothing to eat, you like fresh food - don't try to look for it here - it is not there, I am silent about seasonal fruits and vegetables, the meat is bad and without choice and is three days old, new dishes are mixed from the day before yesterday, soups are cooked at best and sent back for distribution. On the positive side: we checked in right away - lucky, powerful air conditioning, Bluetooth speaker, regular Wi-Fi, daily replenishment of the minibar, good view of the sea (if the suite is on the upper floors, then the standard has a view of the neighboring hotel/road/parking lot and is barely visible sea according to reviews of neighbors) By the way, about the neighbors - when discussing their vacation they mentioned the same problems.

The pool on the property is very clean, but it was enough for us, the sea is very clean. Another highlight is the pool, where music is played daily and waiters serve drinks immediately. One day the hotel hosted a pool party, which was well planned and fun.

In the so-called swimming pool it takes about an hour before there is almost enough water in it to swim, but then you can no longer drain the water.

In the so-called swimming pool it takes about an hour before there is almost enough water in it to swim, but then you can no longer drain the water. The beach is quite small, rocky entrance to the water. Water and electricity are constantly turned off.

Spa and Wellness i√ßin t√ºm sonu√ßlar metni: I tried spa massage, there is very negative criticism about the spa here, but the massage, from Tai to the muscle group you mentioned, is done in the smallest details and with great effort. The hotel has several bars, a buffet restaurant, a pastry shop, a fitness room, a spa and a nightclub on level -1. Yorum: I do not recommend, high price, 3 * quality, we have been coming to Turkey for 19 years, this year I tried an "adult" hotel, but I had a bitter taste, from the moment I got to the room, the lights, air conditioning, soap, soap did not work gel from a can, sad for a hotel that has only been open for 2 months üò™ we expected something special, but enough junk, we could not use the sauna, turkish bath, the spa man asked us for money, we were verbally harassed that I did not accept it, I told the management to a skinny blonde girl (customer relations)? I would advise you to avoid the spa at all costs, the prices are inadequate, the staff are unpleasant, pushy, pull your hand and offer services that do not meet the promises.

Yorum: Great, great spa with Dr. The complex has a fitness studio with the latest equipment and a huge wellness area. We found it very positive that we were not constantly bothered with "offers" for wellness, etc. I tried spa massage, there is very negative criticism about the spa here, but the massage, from Tai to the muscle group you mentioned, is done in the smallest details and with great effort. A wide variety of massages are offered, from therapeutic to relaxing, but they only offer imitation Thai massages. As a massage therapist with years of experience, I can say that I had major questions about the technique of my master's degree. By the way, the peeling and foam massage was done at 4 o'clock. The price of the massage is simply exorbitant, even in the center of Moscow you can get it cheaper from a good specialist. During the massage and procedures, other people are constantly brought along to observe how the procedures are going. Jusuf extra Thai massage, hotel everything was great, food extra, 34. It is a new hotel üëç but it has nothing to do with ,,adult,, lack of atmosphere, fun, food, space, sea with pebbles, the pool is fff busy and you disturb without wanting to, the staff is ok but only Turkish, the management just walks, it is fff cold, without feeling any comfort, soap, shampoo in a terrible bottle, a plus for the fridge, the room is always full, bartenders üí™üç∑, I could only use the sauna, Turkish bath for money? Yorum: An unpleasant experience for a newly opened 5* hotel, which does not reach 3*, I did not understand the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãan "adult hotel", maybe a retirement home, I had other expectations from a GRANATA hotel, this is the weakest, it is full of Russians and old Germans, who have priority, although I was there in September and I was with about 15-20 Romanians, I kept insisting, the lack of entertainment activities, especially because there is a lack of space, it is fff small, the sauna, the turkish bath was for money, Mr. wine of food, a plus, the refrigerator is fed daily, the room is in order, everything new, the lack of an indoor pool, sauna, Turkish bath only for money, the lack of entertainers, a bad hotel , in entertainment activities below expectations, so avoid this hotel 19. Yorum: I do not recommend, high price, 3 * quality, we have been coming to Turkey for 19 years, this year I tried an "adult" hotel, but I had a bitter taste, from the moment I got to the room, the lights, air conditioning, soap, soap did not work gel from a can, sad for a hotel that has only been open for 2 months üò™ we expected something special, but enough junk, we could not use the sauna, turkish bath, the spa man asked us for money, we were verbally harassed that I did not accept it, I told the management to a skinny blonde girl (customer relations)? Yorum: The hotel is not 5*, we were disappointed, it has nothing to do with an "adult" hotel, canteen food, good drinks but few dishes, lack of atmosphere, hospital-like corridors, bar staff and waitresses attentive if you give a tip, program for pensioners in the evening, swimming pool of 1.40, we could not use the Turkish bath and sauna, the man of the spa asked us for money so that we could access hand in hand with the management SHAME has nothing to do with GRANADA hotels 28. Yorum: A location below expectations is not 5*, I had a missed holiday, the room was ok, the people were ok, the food was pathetic, the mess, the beach was crowded, the sunbeds were terrible, you stood in line to wash your feet in something improvised, the disco in the basement was ok, few drinks, we complained that we were harassed by the spa gentleman for the sauna and the turkish bath, they asked us for money, so we could not benefit from these included services, I liked the hotel theme,,,adult,, not cold, not the atmosphere, small space, lack of activity, atmosphere.. Of the pluses: purely for relaxation for two, clean sea, comfortable room minus the view and noise outside the window, the beach is right on the hotel grounds. We cannot understand the reviews of some writers, neither about the too many Eastern European guests, nor about their preferential treatment. It is a pleasure to have a jacuzzi in our room. The room has a jacuzzi with which we had problems 2 times, they tried to fix it but it didn't work It would be nice to replace the water drainage system. Overall we rate the room 8/10 (because of the view and issues with the jacuzzi, but you might be fine with that) Overall the room is tidy. Jacuzzi worked well, safe, wifi was excellent everywhere. It features a Jacuzzi directly in the room with a glass wall overlooking the shower, making it less suitable for families or people who are not traveling alone. Also in the room the blinds for the window by the jacuzzi did not work and cold water flowed from the hot tap of the jacuzzi and vice versa. 3) A jacuzzi is generally a rectangular bath with 6 jets on the sides, the effect is not a full-fledged jacuzzi. I will attach a photo of the room, which is very nice with jacuzzi and minibar. The room is tidy, I really liked the spacious jacuzzi and the minibar that is refilled every day. Small, the bed is bad, the pillows are stone, the jacuzzi needs to be washed and washed, the windows and balconies are covered in bird droppings - no one will wash anything. I chose medicinal, they did a kind of Thai and put stones on me, my companion chose aromatherapy, but she also got Thai, without using aromatic oils, they used basic coconut oil.

Hijyenik Tatil i√ßin t√ºm sonu√ßlar metni: Cleanliness does not meet 5 star standard. The gentleman who cleans the pool is a wonderful person. The cleaning lady, Bahar, is friendly and careful in her work. Cleanliness does not meet 5 star standard. Since it is a new hotel, it is very clean and well maintained. Check-in is from 12:00 to 14:00, depending on how quickly your future room is cleaned. The pool on the property is very clean, but it was enough for us, the sea is very clean. The rooms are clean, everything is there, the bar is constantly stocked, although there are 4 bars on site and they pour everything as much as you want and the fridge is not particularly useful. One minor drawback is that the rooms were cleaned within 6 days; they didn't change the toothbrush, soap, shampoo, etc. The cuisine is delicious and varied, the environment is clean, you feel safe, the beach is good, free minibar. Cleaning is done daily. The room was very clean and specially designed for couples. And toothbrushes don't clean your teeth at all. Cleaning is done daily and the minibar is also restocked daily. Of the staff, the two gentlemen who run the pool bar during the day and evening are very friendly and competent, and the older gentleman who cleans the pool is also nice. The rooms are clean, cleaned daily. The beach is small but clean. Of the pluses: purely for relaxation for two, clean sea, comfortable room minus the view and noise outside the window, the beach is right on the hotel grounds. We were very pleased with the services provided, from receptionists to cleaning and food services. The rooms are clean. the sea is clean. The dishes are partially clean and intact.

On the positive side: we checked in right away - lucky, powerful air conditioning, Bluetooth speaker, regular Wi-Fi, daily replenishment of the minibar, good view of the sea (if the suite is on the upper floors, then the standard has a view of the neighboring hotel/road/parking lot and is barely visible sea according to reviews of neighbors) By the way, about the neighbors - when discussing their vacation they mentioned the same problems. A big advantage is the location of the hotel, it is on the first line directly on the beach, at the accommodation you get cards that you exchange for beach towels and in the evening you exchange them again. weak internet, asylum atmosphere, cold, no flower, arrangements, no music, the evening program mediocre, the lack of mattresses on the sunbeds and squished by the pool, the sea with stones, the restaurant with canteen food, the lack of an a la carte restaurant location, but you pay, plus the drinks per bottle, even though we didn't even have Campari or digestive, sweets, juices, the staff at the bar and the friendly girls, I had no claims, only services included in the priceüòú for 5 * and the price paid I mention that we were with several families and that there were about 20 dissatisfied families in the hotel 21. Yorum: A location below expectations is not 5*, I had a missed holiday, the room was ok, the people were ok, the food was pathetic, the mess, the beach was crowded, the sunbeds were terrible, you stood in line to wash your feet in something improvised, the disco in the basement was ok, few drinks, we complained that we were harassed by the spa gentleman for the sauna and the turkish bath, they asked us for money, so we could not benefit from these included services, I liked the hotel theme,,,adult,, not cold, not the atmosphere, small space, lack of activity, atmosphere.. The hotel's beach area welcomes you with fine sand and a beautiful sea. Of the munos: There is no area near the hotel, (very small) Actually a hotel, a swimming pool, a beach and a place for evening programs In general this is the main drawback, but even this does not play a big role. The complex has a fitness studio with the latest equipment and a huge wellness area. The outdoor area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe restaurant does not invite you to linger, as you are looking at white concrete walls on all sides. Among the minuses: there is no ironing, there is no room with a sea view from the standard rooms, the hotel area is quite small and there is no quiet place to relax, there are no embankments or other places to walk, the staff does not speak English or Russian, and there were communication problems. (and normal hotels organize the area in such a way that strangers do not have the opportunity to go deep into the beach and use the infrastructure, and the guards did not have the opportunity to perform tricks). The room has a jacuzzi with which we had problems 2 times, they tried to fix it but it didn't work It would be nice to replace the water drainage system. Beach: There are sun loungers, the entrance is sandy, the place was almost always there, but the entrance is quite deep, about 7 meters from the beach, the depth is already 2 meters. Of the munos: There is no area near the hotel, (very small) Actually a hotel, a swimming pool, a beach and a place for evening programs In general this is the main drawback, but even this does not play a big role. Not replaced and in general there is no feeling of freshness (it seems like a new hotel) The staff is not bad, but no one speaks Russian! I recommend this hotel especially to couples looking for a comfortable, modern and well-equipped place for a relaxing holiday. The hotel does not have any green space, not even a few plants for decoration, if you appreciate that kind of thing you are in the wrong place. Among the minuses: there is no ironing, there is no room with a sea view from the standard rooms, the hotel area is quite small and there is no quiet place to relax, there are no embankments or other places to walk, the staff does not speak English or Russian, and there were communication problems. I recommend it with confidence If you want to feel wonderful, GRANADA LUXURY RED is the right place for you!

Parti Deneyimi i√ßin t√ºm sonu√ßlar metni: Every day new towels provided a very good level, different groups perform, a cool DJ + different shows, Pirate party, Pena party, fire show which we also had. One day the hotel hosted a pool party, which was well planned and fun. The view from the balcony is so-so, at least in our room it has a bluetooth system that allows you to connect from your phone and listen to music. Every day there is a show, music. Another highlight is the pool, where music is played daily and waiters serve drinks immediately. In addition, the nightclub, located on level -1, can be disturbing for guests who go to bed early, as the music can be heard throughout the hotel until 2am. I recommend it for guests who like to go to bed before 2am as the music plays until then. Yorum: One of the worst hotels we visited: the elevator was not working during the whole visit - 9 days, and the nightclub music until 2am. And as if that wasn't enough, Russian music is played during the evening programme, but in the afternoon you can also let yourself be driven away by Eastern European songs at massive volume. weak internet, asylum atmosphere, cold, no flower, arrangements, no music, the evening program mediocre, the lack of mattresses on the sunbeds and squished by the pool, the sea with stones, the restaurant with canteen food, the lack of an a la carte restaurant location, but you pay, plus the drinks per bottle, even though we didn't even have Campari or digestive, sweets, juices, the staff at the bar and the friendly girls, I had no claims, only services included in the priceüòú for 5 * and the price paid I mention that we were with several families and that there were about 20 dissatisfied families in the hotel 21.

A very important point is that the hotel is 16+, there are no children, it is very quiet and without shouting, this is an important point for us. The children relieved themselves directly on the beach at the shoreline. There are many children on the beach in this adults-only hotel.
