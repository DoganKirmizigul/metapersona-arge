The staff are exceptionally kind and caring, great location too! Staff are very friendly and attentive. Top quality drinks, great food 24/7, extremely friendly and professional staff. The chefs and staff take great care in preparing and presenting each dish, making dining a delightful part of the stay. We were very impressed by the staff who did their best to be at our disposal, being very helpful all the time. Mainly due to staff at reception and some of the kitchen staff. Given the severity of the injury and the possibility of further injury, it is evident that this type of slide required a member of staff both at the top and the bottom to ensure the bottom was clear before any other people came down the slide. I noticed that there were members of staff there but they did not appear to be observing what we were doing, they were clearly not paying attention or keeping an eye on the hotel goers attending the park. The injury was actually caused by the other children crashing into me, which would not have happened if staff made sure the slide was clear before allowing others to use it. The hotel and its staff have a duty of care to its guests, particularly in an unsafe environment that is frequented by young children. Yorum: Amazing hotel with kind and helpful staff.

From the friendly greeting at the reception when we arrived, to the day we left – the staff could not be nicer. We struck a special rapport with a few of the staff in the restaurant area who were always very nice, and I must drop a few names - AHMET GEEZER (such a lovely chap, big smile every day and a warm friendly greeting – he even would look out for us in the outdoor restaurant at lunch time. The entertainment staff were also brilliant MR POKERFACE – was a great chap and every evening would introduce the shows on stage with great enthusiasm - but he also would do the same at the pool. The cleaning staff in all areas were excellent and the chambermaids – all so nice. The other thing is that ALL the staff we came across not only were friendly and warm but had a very positive energy – which is a very important component. The happy energy of the staff everywhere was a massive plus point. Thank you to ALL the staff at DI. Plus the staff is very nice and they serve you without limits.

We struck a special rapport with a few of the staff in the restaurant area who were always very nice, and I must drop a few names - AHMET GEEZER (such a lovely chap, big smile every day and a warm friendly greeting – he even would look out for us in the outdoor restaurant at lunch time. The entertainment staff were also brilliant MR POKERFACE – was a great chap and every evening would introduce the shows on stage with great enthusiasm - but he also would do the same at the pool. The cleaning staff in all areas were excellent and the chambermaids – all so nice. The other thing is that ALL the staff we came across not only were friendly and warm but had a very positive energy – which is a very important component. The happy energy of the staff everywhere was a massive plus point. Thank you to ALL the staff at DI. Plus the staff is very nice and they serve you without limits. Thanks to all the staff for a lovely holiday. Yorum: Absoutley disgusting behaviour by staff! Most of the staff is very friendly, but few of them can speak good English and large number don't know it at all. Yorum: Fabulous hotel staff can't do enough for you food in the main restaurant excellent plenty of choices cater for every taste, really look after gusts and even compensate and make special allowances for guests in the restaurant who are disabled. The pools were always clean and surrounding areas always kept tidy, pool staff very attentive. Yorum: Hotel itself and the grounds are gorgeous, the staff are so friendly. Yorum: Amazing hotel with amazing staff. Room staff were such fun. All the staff throughout the hotel were very helpful and friendly however I felt a need to write a review this time round for the sole reason of the Mini club! Hana absolutely loved everything about the mini club, the facilities they offer, the face painting, the different activities planned at different times of the day, the kids shows in the evening, the mini disco every other day but most of all she loved the friendliness of the Mini club staff. I can see the amount of effort the Mini club staff put in to make sure the children have the best holiday ever! The food and drink is 5*, the staff are so friendly and pleasant and nothing is too much trouble for anyone. Friendly staff and the food is overflowing all through-out the day! One day we will turn back to here again It is not so bad thing but sometimes some staff speaking silly with each other they just need to little bit educate. Very high standard and staff is great. Yorum: Very attentive service in the Restaurantsand bars and all the staff are friendly. Yorum: Wonderful hotel, frienly staff, professional service. Comment: Lovely hotel, 5 star service. Regarding drinks and services for sure a 5 star quality, full of kind personal everywhere, good quality drinks. The overall service and diversity of it, was excelent. The hotel smell very bad and rooms ,aminities very old Food was perfect ,room services was perfect . Service was impeccable by reception, restaurant and bar staff always. Greek was amazing, from service to the food. Yorum: The all-inclusive package was great From indulging in rejuvenating spa services to relishing an array of delectable food options, the hotel provided a comprehensive and satisfying holiday experience. We would have preferred a more subtle approach to service, allowing guests to savor their dining experience without feeling constantly interrupted. Opting for an Uber instead, we paid only £11, highlighting a significant price difference and leaving us questioning the hotel's transparency in their transportation services. Yorum: The services about cleaning, food and staff are very good, but that's all, the problem it s the entertaiment, a lot of activities they are canceld, the Park pool it's closed almost all of the time, sunday night after 23:30 everything it's closed, we were a group of 10 person staying în front of the hotel just to have one drink... Yorum: Great service, well furnished, we visited in February all sections of the hotel was working except rainy days. Yorum: This is the best hotel I have ever been but the service can't really speak English but I recommend this place it's beautiful and very fun you can do 49. Its a good place for all kinds of age group with all the facilities and services available and provided. The room was clean, the service was great, a lot of stuff are inclusive, the food was really good, the staffs are kind and friendly. Service is great, food is amazing (a lot of different types of dishes and very very tasty). Yorum: Just back after 10 days at the Imperial, it is a fantastic hotel, service is outstanding at every location, everywhere is spotless( never used a bathroom that hadn’t been cleaned in the past 15 mins)food is wonderful. Service was excellent from start to finish. There were plenty of activities for the kids to do, the food was mind blowing, the service was excellent overall very happy with our choice. Otherwise staff & especially managers are excellent at resturants and sitting area where excellent service had been provided looking after they customers very well. In the restaurants and bars, the staff provided exemplary service. I had the pleasure of conversing with Samira, who works in the customer relations service. To the entire staff of this hotel, I extend my heartfelt gratitude for your kindness, dedication, and exceptional service. Yorum: I would rate this hotel 1/5 simply because of the service. Excellent service, amazing kids entertainment, wonderful buffet and super helpful staff. The service is top quality. From the moment we arrived the service was absolutely incredible. The hotel is 21 minutes from the airport (I timed it), the food, drinks, hygiene, service, kindness and many many more aspects were 10/10. We ate in 3 of the a la carte restaurants, service was brilliant again but its a set type menu and alot of it I think you could maybe find in the buffet as there's just so much in there. Nice to have table service a couple of nights though. Food and Service is a VIP level. Service 11/10 This place is marvelous. The hotel has several themed restaurants, the service is all inclusive. The service is excellent, very polite. Yorum: Service in this hotel is amazing, everyone happy to help you with everything, specially with drink and food... With the kind of service this hotel provides, why would you want to go elsewhere. Had its own chocolate shop 😃 the hotel was full near the end of our trip but we still got the same service. For his very good service and kindness 109. Food and services are exceptional and the lobby is an outstanding wherever you wish to meet sit and a free beverages are served with smiles. Great service. There are additional services which you can pay for at a reasonable price. The service was brilliant. Great service, friendly staff and the selection of food was never ending! Cannot fault the service.. Yorum: from the accommodation, the spacious and clean big room, the diversified menu and for all tastes, all the cleaning staff, the very nice and attentive food service and the chefs. Right from the customer service to food from everyday activities to dj night to cinema to kids activities to hamam and spa things one of the best resort i ever seen. They had 24/7 restaurants and bar open so if you are like me who love clubbing and coming late they had their restaurants open and if you are a premium customer like me u get room services and bar anytime and wherever u r sitting either its lounge area/spa or wherever you are. Their room services are excellent i stayed for a wk in this resort really it was an amazing experience right from the cleanliness to food and dessert options. Also, RAMAZAN AMAG as well as a few others whose names I did not take down but will remember their friendly service. The price was much higher than the others we have visited and even that would have been acceptable, if the service was exceptional. The service is perfect. Food, drinks, heated pools, saunas, service were superb. Minimal Corona limitations ( masks in the restaurant and no self service). Yorum: Very good hotel services. Only tip would be to take your own travel iron as they do not provide them during your stay, you are to use their laundry services which charge per item. Yorum: We stayed there 10 days , Service and food was so good. Hotel Rooms - Excellent Hotel Presentation - outstanding Hotel Pool area - Excellent Hotel Food - Excellent Hotel Service - Excellent 168. Hotel is nice, but due to execrable taxi service in that area we will not visit again. The rooms are clean and the service personal are very friendly. The service was 1st class really outstanding and I've been to Atlantis the Palm and Jumeira Beech hotel. Yorum: Very attentive service in the Restaurantsand bars and all the staff are friendly. I'm asking for the money back It is also important to note that they do not give service and do not want to talk to you always say do not understand you I sent a reporter all the email addresses of the hotel three days ago and to this day no one has answered 178. Yorum: Wonderful hotel, frienly staff, professional service.

Su Kaydırağı için tüm sonuçlar metni: I have been on many water slides as well as my son so we know how to safely go down a slide. There was supposed to be a bunch of water slides but there was t even a pool. They have pools , different types of water slides an a kiddies pool with things to do. The great news is, Delphin Imperial are building a new Aqua park which is due to open in May/June. However, the aqua park they already have was perfect for us. The aqua park is excellent for you to enjoy the afternoon. As February is one of the cold months, the water rides and aqua park were closed. There's also an Aqua Bar, Luna Park and Aqua Park and a beach at the back of the hotel!! At the top I asked the lifeguard on duty who was stationed at the top of the slide which slide we could go on and he pointed to the white and burgundy slide. He helped us get onto the float and made sure we were sitting securely before pushing us down the slide. I had my son in my lap and we were holding on tight [the lifeguard was happy for me to hold my son in this manner whilst going down the slide]. Unfortunately, a few seconds in, the float flipped over and we fell off the float whilst sliding down the slide. The float went down the slide away from us. We were stuck for 5 minutes in the middle of the slide and no one came to help us. I decided not to stand up and try walk back down the slide as there was a great risk of falling and causing further danger to my son and I. Whilst sitting down, I shuffled slightly down the slide and then we found the float we were originally in. Two older children then came crashing down the slide in a big 8 float. Given the severity of the injury and the possibility of further injury, it is evident that this type of slide required a member of staff both at the top and the bottom to ensure the bottom was clear before any other people came down the slide. The injury was actually caused by the other children crashing into me, which would not have happened if staff made sure the slide was clear before allowing others to use it. I have been on many water slides as well as my son so we know how to safely go down a slide. There was supposed to be a bunch of water slides but there was t even a pool. The spa seemed nice enough, and there were even a few medium sized water park slides, which was a great addition! They have pools , different types of water slides an a kiddies pool with things to do. Kids wise there is 2 pools for little ones, one for kids who love slides but not so deep 0.85m and there is 2 other big adult pools with a section where kids can also enjoy on a shallow end at 1.4m. With it being the winter concept, many things were closed, such as the slides and the other pools and kids aquapark. There were a lot of activities to choose from such as pool games, beach activities and daily evening shows organized by the hotel. The rooms are decent and the pools are fabulous. One thing we found great, they go out of the way to provide food and drinks throughout the resort, even with waiters on skates around the pools, so you never have an empty glass or stomach. Pools are really nice and clean 7. I absolutely love the fact one can spend 2 weeks without having to be disturbed by noisy children (relax pool plus adult only dining area). The pools are HUGE. Restaurant is huge, swimming pools are huge and sea is just a couple of minutes walk, private beach with everything you may need. Pools and beach are quite nice, the place was pretty narrow, but probably it’s a standard for Lara hotels. There was supposed to be a bunch of water slides but there was t even a pool. Yorum: This was the best hotel ever and the best holiday I’ve had in my entire life, the staff were so nice, friendly and respectful, including the other people that were staying at the hotel, I really loved the food, the food was so brilliant and also the drinks and I really loved the entertainment, the parties, the jet ski and jet car, the beach, the swimming pool and water park and everything else about this hotel. I will give credit to pool staff and pool bar staff they are amazing. The level of organization of everything (food in billion different places, pools, beach…) is at an insanenly high level, everything runs perfectly. From baby pools and playgrounds to night clubs. Yorum: Hi,me and my girlfriend had an amazing time here again, 10th visit,see my previous reviews for details as faultless hotel with the best staff,food,drinks,grounds,pools,everything.|Many thanks to all the staff,see you all soon for our 11th visit.|Tony and Jo(Brighton football supporters from England)👍👍 … 24. There were a lot of activities to choose from such as pool games, beach activities and daily evening shows organized by the hotel. There is no information on activities happening at the hotel except a board at the swimming pool common area which sets out the daily activities. Few outdoor swimming pools including adult area and kids area. We enjoyed our day eating a delicious breakfast, the children were in the pools for hours, they enjoyed food, drinks and ice cream poolside. I would relax by the pool with a lovely cup of coffee from the coffee house. We did not have to leave the pool area for lunch as the outdoor eating choices catered for all of us. Yorum: The services about cleaning, food and staff are very good, but that's all, the problem it s the entertaiment, a lot of activities they are canceld, the Park pool it's closed almost all of the time, sunday night after 23:30 everything it's closed, we were a group of 10 person staying în front of the hotel just to have one drink... The rooms are immaculate and comfortable, and the pool area is breathtaking. Room, pools and all of the amenities are very old. The only missing thing is a jacuzzi in the pool. The pools are massive and of very good quality. On top of all that, you will never get bored at this resort with all the day and night activities they offer: from pool entertainment exercises to daily shows at night, this place will never get you bored. Hotel pools and the beach are very clean. The pools and water park both kids and adults are great. One gripe is that for the last 3 days of our visit kids were allowed to use the relax pool despite there being two huge pools available for them. Yorum: Brilliant hotel beautiful pools amazing food and amazing staff will definitely be coming back no problem with sun bed rooms are beautiful very clean staff are so helpful amazing hospitality 😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎😎 … 57. Pros - Kids club absolutely wonderful - the staff have so much energy and make each child feel special and loved (Kaira in particular was fantastic) - absolutely amazing for children and highlight of our daughters stay - she didn’t want to leave - Huge choice of tasty and fresh food - buffet open breakfast, lunch and dinner but also had toastie station, fresh pizzas and kebabs outside - Good kids and adults entertainment even in winter - different every night for adults and daily disco for kids - Lots of places to get drinks and snacks even in winter - Heated outdoor pool is glorious - Lovely spacious rooms - Friendly staff - particularly Gokhan S in the Pool Bar and the cleaning staff in the restaurant - Salon very reasonable prices Cons - Loud due to layout of rooms facing balcony into lobby - no chance of sleeping pre 11pm and even then people walk past your door and make lots of noise. We mostly stayed by Relax pool where it’s 14+. Everything is just perfect, rooms, staff, food,pools, etc. It has indoor and outdoor big swimming pools. The pool guys helping with sunbeds to the skater waiters never leaving you with an empty glass. On my actual b'day the pool guy brought me some flowers beside the pool all wished me birthday wishes so friendly. However, their indoor pool was heated and it didn't make us feel that we are missing something big. Even though it was winter season there was activities during day, heated outdoor pool and evening entertainment. Good pools and kids facilities excellent WiFi and food is everywhere !!! It has shops, barbers, a spa, bowling and arcade, nightclub, a gym, swimming pool, cinema, doctor clinic and a Camelot Bar, all in one building which is amazing!!! The staff around the pool were also amazing - they were always cleaning up and keeping the sunbed area clean all day long. 😀 The rollerskate team around the pools were also really friendly and attentive. The food choices for all inclusive is amazing, the added extras like the food shacks by the pools, (fresh made pizza, waffles, hot dogs, nuggets, chips, kebab, burgers, fruit stand, coffees/cake stand and more) was brilliant. Waiters served you drinks by the pool on roller blades, they were brilliant and so hard working and friendly. ( I think is assistant team leader ) from skate team by the pool his energy and go extra mile attitude to serve every single visitors was noticed . Now for the good points the rest of the hotel / pools, snack bars, cake bars and staff were excellent( not the reception staff they were grumpy and unhelpfull ) rooms are excellent, (we a junior suite) but could see as passing them in the corridors, any. Yorum: I was laying by the pool and told my wife my glasses were dirty. At 18:05 they were cleaning the bar (closing at 18:00) at the indoor pool when I want to order a drink, the waiter brought me the drinks from another bar. Skate team who serves drinks at the pool is really nice. It is the largest in terms of capacity hotel in Lara, there are four outdoor pools, one indoor pool and one children's pool. A special mention to Lukhman & Hassan, both work by the main pool. From the first time I entered the hotel to the rooms, the restaurant, the outdoor and indoor pools, every part of the hotel was 5 star. Yorum: We visited this hotel in feb half term with kids, i must say hotel is amazing we bought all inclusive package and we loved it every second we stayed in Delphin Imperial there pools are nice warm (indoors and outdoors ) according to temperature. Good pools for children and adults. The non meal food options (eg pizza makers near the pool, ice creams etc) were all great. Pools & Beach: There were 3 large outdoor pools. The indoor pool wasn't heated the first time we used it but later in the week it was - much nicer warm, not sure why they didn't have it heated all the time. Loads of beds around the pool and beach area. Staff & Entertainment: The skate team around the pool were very quick and always helpful. The staff from reception, lobby bar, restaurant and pool bar were all brilliant and very helpful . Would like to see hotel in the summer oh and the heated pool was a massive bonus for some winter sun . They have pools , different types of water slides an a kiddies pool with things to do. Waiters by the pool so helpful!! Kids wise there is 2 pools for little ones, one for kids who love slides but not so deep 0.85m and there is 2 other big adult pools with a section where kids can also enjoy on a shallow end at 1.4m. pools kept clean, evening entertainment is varied. The food, the room, the pools and all the activities were excellent. Lovely beach bar with little bistro tables overlooking the sea xxx heated outdoor pool xxx 115. The family really enjoyed their stay, Ali at the Wave bar (pool bar) definitely the star on his Roller Blades, absolute star with my son Shay. The pools are well maintained and clean. Nice SPA and heated swimming pool. Yorum: A really big hotel and has many pools including an indoor pool(heated). 5 pools, just a few steps to the beach, breakfast, lunch and dinner outside on the terrace at the fresh air or in the air-conditioned interiors. Drinks are brought to the pools and you are always asked what you would like. Great view from the balcony of the pools and the sea. About snacks when we were there just one day was rained and after that we have not seen yard's snack any more even in the building (The next days was sunny) The indoor pool temprature was kinda cold for this session but about outdoor pool the temprature was great. Doctor's advised it was due to uncooked food, possibly fish or poor sanitation from the pool. They have their private saloon,spa shopping stores, hot indoor and outdoor pools private beach everyday musical nights/cultural shows everything in the same place what more we want. Yorum: Thank you for making my birthday special today best resort ever on here is smiling and helpful the pool is perfect and the food is amazing with many choices , thank you again and sure am going to miss you ❤️‍🔥 when am going to leave tomorrow 145. The entertainment staff were also brilliant MR POKERFACE – was a great chap and every evening would introduce the shows on stage with great enthusiasm - but he also would do the same at the pool. I say the biggest thanks to the young man Hysein who serves cocktails by the pool. Family friendly : even if apparently is a family friendly hotel you find a lot of problems, the food is horrible for children, the water in the pools is almost toxic (all the children - no 6 - made dermatite - and if you want to go to the medical cabinet the doctor is present only on call and it will cost you 150 euro the consultation.) ; when I went to the client help office I was told that maybe the children are sensitive... Food, drinks, heated pools, saunas, service were superb. We had a minor complaint regarding the sunbeds at the pool which was dealt with effectively by guest relations. The hotel had an outdoor heated pool which was really good. With it being the winter concept, many things were closed, such as the slides and the other pools and kids aquapark. There was a cinema and an entertainment centre, but you had to pay a lot for ps5, or some snooker/pool, bowling etc. Pools are huge and parts of them will have nice shadows from palms and other vegetation but pools never get deeper than 140cm so on hot days they become very hot. There is a number of beach and pool bars with food and snacks but I didn't eat much at them. The pools were always clean and surrounding areas always kept tidy, pool staff very attentive. Heated indoor and outdoor pools, plenty of eating places outdoors as well. Hotel Rooms - Excellent Hotel Presentation - outstanding Hotel Pool area - Excellent Hotel Food - Excellent Hotel Service - Excellent 168. Yorum: At 14:00 on 20/06/24 I got a round doughnut float with my son which was provided by the water park. I initially thought I would be able to get back into the float with my son, however it was too difficult with the water going down at speed and I did not want to endanger my son. As a result, the four of us went all the way into the water. We then came out of the water and I felt further excruciating pain. I have been on many water slides as well as my son so we know how to safely go down a slide. There was supposed to be a bunch of water slides but there was t even a pool.

The water park here was excellent, however BE Grand was overwhelming big. Our visit in November, while generally pleasant, was met with disappointment as the water rides, a key attraction, were unexpectedly closed. As long as there was a water park and beach for the kids, then I was happy.. The pools and water park both kids and adults are great. You can also access to private beach and all water activities. You can grab ice cream and cold water (or any cold or hot drink you might think of, but with 45 degrees, believe me, cold water is the must have) pretty much everywhere. As February is one of the cold months, the water rides and aqua park were closed. I especially loved attending water yoga every morning and the entertainment team kept everyone in a great mood with their fun water activities. Water sports are available on the side. Water is not heated so a bit cold. The spa seemed nice enough, and there were even a few medium sized water park slides, which was a great addition! -Not a real 5 star / may be 4 star Avoid SEP-MAR since it’s their winter hence no Air conditioning or any water park games. They have pools , different types of water slides an a kiddies pool with things to do. The coffee tastes like water and the rooms are dirty. Overall had a great time just watermelon, cashew nuts and indian food was missing part as I'm big found of this food and 129.

There were 2 problems, one room was overlooking the garden, but there was no garden, you couldn't open your balcony door because you could hear a loud noise from the generators or whatever they were, and a pretty serious problem they didn't want to help me put 2 small bags of gel in the freezer to freeze them as they are needed to transport the medicine (injection), I am coming by car, this is not possible, I have proof from the doctor for that medicine, prescription , medical letter, etc 26. Opting for an Uber instead, we paid only £11, highlighting a significant price difference and leaving us questioning the hotel's transparency in their transportation services. She, the security guard, demanded our taxi turn back around and we were not welcome in the hotel. I had to leave the taxi who was parked at the entrance with security shouting at the poor taxi man who was not in fault for waiting there for this to be resolved! Another point of contention was the insistence on using the hotel's taxis, with an exorbitant charge of £40 to the airport. Yorum: Hotel is great but the taxi drivers outside the location are rip off merchants & con men. Yorum: 1 stars for location due to taxi scammers perturbing our vacation by refusing to start taximeter when pickingup /dropping to this hotel! Hotel is nice, but due to execrable taxi service in that area we will not visit again. There is a lady called" taxi chef ", so it doesn't metter if you are on a rush going somewhere, the taxi driver will stop to this lady for making you the price, usually 4-5 times more than it worth! 20 mins from Antalya airport and Land of Legends. Another point of contention was the insistence on using the hotel's taxis, with an exorbitant charge of £40 to the airport. The hotel is 21 minutes from the airport (I timed it), the food, drinks, hygiene, service, kindness and many many more aspects were 10/10. The hotel is located near the airport and it is very easy to get to the city center or other sights. Yorum: Location is good, less than 20min from the airport. We used private transfer for hotel&airport and airport&hotel. It was busy in February so I can only imagine it would be absolutely packed in the warmer months! Hotel is in pristine condition despite being so busy and so big. Personnel is friendly and happy, Free bustrip to Antalya, free beach bag. All I would say is that it gets busy as guests rotate roughly every two weeks. Very busy place and a lot happening. Despite being fully booked, it never felt too busy or crammed, as the hotel is so big! If its not busy, they let you habe numerous turns! The hotel was very busy, entertainment is extremely noisy. I would return, because although there was work going on which disrupted the calm, i can imagine summertime would be really cool here, but it was so busy in the winter time, i don't think there would be any space in the hotel in the Peak summer time. Fitness trainers did a great job keeping us fit, considering how much food we ate… we really appreciated them. All the the employees are professional and special thanks to Omar the gym trainer . The staff are exceptionally kind and caring, great location too! And the best thing is that it doesn’t feel crowded even though there is a lot of people, there’s simply that many different venues/locations within the resort, it really feels like a small seaside town. The hotel ticked every box, location, food, facilities, staff, entertainment and the list goes on. Yorum: Hotel is great but the taxi drivers outside the location are rip off merchants & con men. Location is also good as there are plenty of shops nearby including a migros supermarket for any essentials. Yorum: Just back after 10 days at the Imperial, it is a fantastic hotel, service is outstanding at every location, everywhere is spotless( never used a bathroom that hadn’t been cleaned in the past 15 mins)food is wonderful. Lara beach is also perfect location. Yorum: Hotel and location were fantastic. Location is great, every problem in the room is immediately fixed. Yorum: Very nice hotel nothing to much trouble great location 83. in short hotel is 10/10 location is very nice and there own private beach is amazing. Yorum: Location is good, less than 20min from the airport. Other than this, the beach, location of the hotel and people who work here are really good and friendly. Yorum: 1 stars for location due to taxi scammers perturbing our vacation by refusing to start taximeter when pickingup /dropping to this hotel! Location is also good as there are plenty of shops nearby including a migros supermarket for any essentials. The nurse was lovely but didn't speak English and sent my husband to a hospital, that the hotel have a contract with; you are limited to use any other hospitals nearby. The air conditioning system never worked and the reception confirmed that it doesn’t work when it’s advertised as centrally air conditioned. The AIR CONDITION – in other hotels often have the centralised systems which tend to switch off, have a minimum setting that only goes down to 18c or they are so old, they break down. The reception area is breathtaking with the largest chandiliar we've ever seen! I absolutely love the fact one can spend 2 weeks without having to be disturbed by noisy children (relax pool plus adult only dining area). Thus you are literally left on your own to explore the main areas and corners of the hotel. There is no information on activities happening at the hotel except a board at the swimming pool common area which sets out the daily activities. Few outdoor swimming pools including adult area and kids area. We did not have to leave the pool area for lunch as the outdoor eating choices catered for all of us. As if we were not already having a great time, the day before we left they turned the outside area into 'candy land'. The rooms are immaculate and comfortable, and the pool area is breathtaking. The bathrooms in public areas around the hotel are really clean and nice. The main reception and seating area is spectacular and large. What we liked most is the continuous improvements the management keeps doing, like the new arena for the daily shows, the new area for spirit sports, the cat house 🙂 The variety and quality in everything is the key success factor we have experienced so far. Yorum: In the dictionary, the word ‘imperial’ means “majestic or magnificent” this hotel was exactly that, the lobby area is just wow. We stayed here for a week and loved every bit from the atmosphere of the place, to the friendly staff, the spa area and not to mention the great huge variety in food. Otherwise staff & especially managers are excellent at resturants and sitting area where excellent service had been provided looking after they customers very well. They were always willing to assist in transferring him to different areas, ensuring his comfort and making him feel valued as a guest. The staff around the pool were also amazing - they were always cleaning up and keeping the sunbed area clean all day long. I loved the fantastic barbecue at the food/bar area during the daytime and the different live bands that performed at night. There's always plenty of tables in the buffet restaurant there's also a seperate smoking area one and one for adults only. The entertainment it was quite good but we preferred the lounge area with the live music. Loads of beds around the pool and beach area. The many guests are well distributed over the large area. The playground area has about 6 rides and the bumper cars are the best! Be careful when using the tong to pick food, you can easily burn your hand on lower heat light area. The hotel stinks of cigarette smell and there are no designated areas for smokers, you see people smoking in front of young children and walking to rooms you can smell the heavy smells of cigarettes. They had 24/7 restaurants and bar open so if you are like me who love clubbing and coming late they had their restaurants open and if you are a premium customer like me u get room services and bar anytime and wherever u r sitting either its lounge area/spa or wherever you are. One major point they lack is they dont speak english only one or two from reception they understand us well so if you speak english you have to speak slowly so that they can catch us lol but overall the staff is really really so good that they are always there to help you right from the dine area to the bar. The lobby area was nicely chilled and unlike one of the hotels (Sherwood) we stayed in previously they do not appear to switch the air con off in the many areas in the lobby (no matter how sparsely occupied). The main restaurant area was not as cool as it could be, so we always tried to take a table in the ‘corridor’ section which was coolest. We struck a special rapport with a few of the staff in the restaurant area who were always very nice, and I must drop a few names - AHMET GEEZER (such a lovely chap, big smile every day and a warm friendly greeting – he even would look out for us in the outdoor restaurant at lunch time. The cleaning staff in all areas were excellent and the chambermaids – all so nice. There were so many people working in all areas, which was nice to see as it is the reason why everything ran like clockwork. For the much higher price at DI, the quality in ALL areas needs to be reflected and be consistent. The lobby area was huge, with lots of seating, drinks, a patisserie bar with ice cream, a chocolate bar, places to just chill and play games. The spa area was really good too, with steam room, saunas and hammam. The pools were always clean and surrounding areas always kept tidy, pool staff very attentive. Hotel Rooms - Excellent Hotel Presentation - outstanding Hotel Pool area - Excellent Hotel Food - Excellent Hotel Service - Excellent 168. Hotel is nice, but due to execrable taxi service in that area we will not visit again. Loads to do here and all in one place. The place has everything you need for great vacation, but somehow doesn’t feel like you get the 5 star experience. Pools and beach are quite nice, the place was pretty narrow, but probably it’s a standard for Lara hotels. Due to the fact that the evening was very warm and narrow place evening activities outside were not an option. The dock and the bar on the dock was amazing, to bad the places were limited. I am blown away by the amount of different things to do and places to go. The level of organization of everything (food in billion different places, pools, beach…) is at an insanenly high level, everything runs perfectly. This is the place to be. Yorum: Only book this place if you are a retired millionaire and want to stay drunk all day. Not a good value for money and won’t recommend this place to anyone. The toilets in the room not working correctly, some places not cleaned in the lobby and not well-maintained. Yorum: I really wanted to love this place. I know if it a family friendly place but we tried to avoid any school holidays- didn't matter, there were screaming kids everywhere. Yorum: This is the best hotel I have ever been but the service can't really speak English but I recommend this place it's beautiful and very fun you can do 49. Yorum: Highly recommended place. We been to so many places and hotels but the comfort level is so good in this one and it's beyond any words to describe. Its a good place for all kinds of age group with all the facilities and services available and provided. On top of all that, you will never get bored at this resort with all the day and night activities they offer: from pool entertainment exercises to daily shows at night, this place will never get you bored. Definitely an excellent place for the price. PS: if you have kids, they will love this place even more. The place is very clean. Basically a very nice place for families. This place is genuinely perfect for kids and families - clean, large and animation shows in the evening are just as good.. Pros - Kids club absolutely wonderful - the staff have so much energy and make each child feel special and loved (Kaira in particular was fantastic) - absolutely amazing for children and highlight of our daughters stay - she didn’t want to leave - Huge choice of tasty and fresh food - buffet open breakfast, lunch and dinner but also had toastie station, fresh pizzas and kebabs outside - Good kids and adults entertainment even in winter - different every night for adults and daily disco for kids - Lots of places to get drinks and snacks even in winter - Heated outdoor pool is glorious - Lovely spacious rooms - Friendly staff - particularly Gokhan S in the Pool Bar and the cleaning staff in the restaurant - Salon very reasonable prices Cons - Loud due to layout of rooms facing balcony into lobby - no chance of sleeping pre 11pm and even then people walk past your door and make lots of noise. We stayed here for a week and loved every bit from the atmosphere of the place, to the friendly staff, the spa area and not to mention the great huge variety in food. Perfect place 66. Yorum: Great place even if I was there for work. Despite the hotel's enormous size, there isn't a single place that isn't impeccably clean. But all in all a fantastic place 75. Terrible place and would not recommend 77. The pier was a great place to enjoy good drinks and snacks. These are just some examples of what you will experience at this place. Service 11/10 This place is marvelous. Very busy place and a lot happening. On the whole it was a nice place and the night time entertainment is superb! Just perfect place for holidays 96. We loved this place everything was perfect. The pier is a great place to lay down your weary head and soak up the sun while feeling the light breeze of the med. He will take you to place not listed in the package and make commission from your purchase. They have their private saloon,spa shopping stores, hot indoor and outdoor pools private beach everyday musical nights/cultural shows everything in the same place what more we want. They have bowling/snooker place for adults and kids gaming zone too. We generally say we want to try a new place every year – but for the first time, we do feel that we may return to DI, as overall it is pretty much the best one we have stayed at. The lobby area was huge, with lots of seating, drinks, a patisserie bar with ice cream, a chocolate bar, places to just chill and play games. Heated indoor and outdoor pools, plenty of eating places outdoors as well. Super amazing place!!! Yorum: Perfect place to go path direct to beach perfect I'm still here till 21st definitely come again got everything you need specially all inclusive package 171. It’s a great place you would go back again like many others do.

Çocuklu Tatil (2-10 yaş) için tüm sonuçlar metni: Yorum: **Delphin Imperial Hotel Review** I recently stayed at the Delphin Imperial Hotel in Turkey with my family, and it was an outstanding experience. The kids’ club and family-friendly activities were particularly appreciated, making it easy for both kids and parents to have fun. It’s the perfect destination for a memorable family vacation in Turkey, providing enjoyment and relaxation for all ages. Family friendly and there is a lots of things to do for children and adult. This has to be the worst all inclusive i have been to, the staff have no communication skills hardly understand any english, very rude , and the guest relations is no help at all, i went with my family was totally disappointed, the food and facilities is not worth the money. My wife booked the 2 rooms for our family and the grandmother. I know if it a family friendly place but we tried to avoid any school holidays- didn't matter, there were screaming kids everywhere. Yorum: An excellent 5-star resort for you and your family. Yorum: I stayed here with my family between the dates of 28th August till 2nd September 2023. Yorum: My family and I spent 11 nights here. Highly recommend it to others, especially with a young family. Yorum: We went on a family holiday. Yorum: A wonderful experience for the family. Yorum: We stayed at Deluxe family suite, which has a great view and lots of room for kids. All in all we will 100% be back and have already recommended the hotel to friends and family. I will definitely ho here again and would recommend it 150% to any family. Yorum: We arrived 19/12/21 away for Christmas for the first time , we as a family have been to Turkey over the years , before coming to the delphin imperial not going to lie when reading some of the reviews I was slightly worried , but we had no need from start to finish could not fault the hotel. Yorum: Booked rooms for me and for my family. The family really enjoyed their stay, Ali at the Wave bar (pool bar) definitely the star on his Roller Blades, absolute star with my son Shay. had a sea view family room and the ultra all-inclusive package is out of this world. I stayed in this hotel with my family in summer 2021 and got food poisoning the third day of our vacation. Yorum: We just spent 3 nights with family and absolutely loved it. as we were a family with young children, unfortunately our request was not met. I reserved this hotel for me and my family but since my family is coming from Iran, the hotel forced us to pay 3800 euro more just due to their nationality. Yorum: We stayed at Delphin Imperial this July for our usual annual summer Antalya holiday - a family of 2 adults and 2 children. The FAMILY ROOM was lovely, and the beds are perfectly nice BUT the PILLOWS are too small and terribly lumpy. Yorum: We came as a group of 24 persons (family & friends) and I can say that overall I am very disappointed. Family friendly : even if apparently is a family friendly hotel you find a lot of problems, the food is horrible for children, the water in the pools is almost toxic (all the children - no 6 - made dermatite - and if you want to go to the medical cabinet the doctor is present only on call and it will cost you 150 euro the consultation.) ; when I went to the client help office I was told that maybe the children are sensitive... Yorum: I visited with my family in off-season, in March. Family apartments (2rooms) comfy and clean, daily cleaning. 1st class family orientated hotel. breakfast lunch Dinner the food was catered for Germans on the third day of our stay three of our family had diarrhoea the so called boiled eggs were runny not cooked and one morning were taken off all together.. Yorum: My friend's family went down to this hotel this week They booked through the hotel's website. The kids’ club and family-friendly activities were particularly appreciated, making it easy for both kids and parents to have fun. They forced me also to wear the hand bracelet all the stay which is uncomfotable ,my 4year kids lost it i asked reception to give new one they asked me 50€ OMG i think if they say hi they need extra charge ... Few outdoor swimming pools including adult area and kids area. I know if it a family friendly place but we tried to avoid any school holidays- didn't matter, there were screaming kids everywhere. One of the best hotels with hardworking and friendly staff, kids friendly, amazing entertainment team and wow the variety of food and taste is just so good. PS: if you have kids, they will love this place even more. The cleaners act very quickly if there is any mess made by kids etc which I thought was very good. I also liked how this hotel had all the apps on the TV so the kids could continue watch their favourite shows. As long as there was a water park and beach for the kids, then I was happy.. There is a midnight till 7am snack bar in the basement, which I ended up using on the first day of arrival as we arrived 2am and kids wide awake. The kids are constantly snacking throughput the day with drinks too. The pools and water park both kids and adults are great. This place is genuinely perfect for kids and families - clean, large and animation shows in the evening are just as good.. the kids club also very attentive. One gripe is that for the last 3 days of our visit kids were allowed to use the relax pool despite there being two huge pools available for them. Pros - Kids club absolutely wonderful - the staff have so much energy and make each child feel special and loved (Kaira in particular was fantastic) - absolutely amazing for children and highlight of our daughters stay - she didn’t want to leave - Huge choice of tasty and fresh food - buffet open breakfast, lunch and dinner but also had toastie station, fresh pizzas and kebabs outside - Good kids and adults entertainment even in winter - different every night for adults and daily disco for kids - Lots of places to get drinks and snacks even in winter - Heated outdoor pool is glorious - Lovely spacious rooms - Friendly staff - particularly Gokhan S in the Pool Bar and the cleaning staff in the restaurant - Salon very reasonable prices Cons - Loud due to layout of rooms facing balcony into lobby - no chance of sleeping pre 11pm and even then people walk past your door and make lots of noise. - Downstairs shop a rip off - €5 for a kids lollipop - Spa is very expensive and not good - 50 min facial included 30 mins of lying with a face mask on in the incredibly noisy spa - A La carte food very average and tiny portions but waiters lovely (Zuma) - Duvets far too small for beds and soaking wet robes left in the room and not changed. It is also kid friendly so they have stations around the hotel where kids can grab a juice of choclate milk or a yogurt, not to mention the girls in Kids club, Gulistan, Doa and Melissa three amazing and outstanding grils that go out of there way to play and look after the kids in the kids club and then later in the kids disco. They did a good job, from the early morning to the evening they had a lot of different programs for kids, and in the evenings dance parties for kids. There were plenty of activities for the kids to do, the food was mind blowing, the service was excellent overall very happy with our choice. Entertainment for kids and adults as well as a pub with football (live) and a chocolate corner to pamper yourself. But with the tons of activities that the hotel proposes, there is no time to get bored or to Netflix : whether be sports, animations for the kids, concerts or parties at night, there is always some way to have a good time. Excellent service, amazing kids entertainment, wonderful buffet and super helpful staff. The resort has so many things to do for the kids and a private beach as well. Good pools and kids facilities excellent WiFi and food is everywhere !!! Yorum: We stayed at Deluxe family suite, which has a great view and lots of room for kids. We chose this hotel because of our small kids, lots of entertainment for them. Night time entertainment was great for kids. I highly recommend this hotel for families with small kids. Especially for kids. Yorum: Great hotel and great facilities for the kids. Your kids will thank you 🙌🏽 95. Not really suited for young kids. Yorum: We visited this hotel in feb half term with kids, i must say hotel is amazing we bought all inclusive package and we loved it every second we stayed in Delphin Imperial there pools are nice warm (indoors and outdoors ) according to temperature. However there own dinner lunch and snack was amazing, bar was great and midnight snack bar was great too, kids loved it all pastry and freshly made bakery items. Kids wise there is 2 pools for little ones, one for kids who love slides but not so deep 0.85m and there is 2 other big adult pools with a section where kids can also enjoy on a shallow end at 1.4m. There is also a little rides section for the kids in the evening as well as access to spa facilities such as sauna and steam room and hammamt. The kids entertainment was perfect. We stayed here for 5 nights with the kids.. Yorum: Fantastic hotel that caters for all kids ages. Right from the customer service to food from everyday activities to dj night to cinema to kids activities to hamam and spa things one of the best resort i ever seen. They have bowling/snooker place for adults and kids gaming zone too. At DI, the larger room we stayed in was nice and chilled, but the kids’ room was less. The air con switches are not digital, so we don’t know if the level was as low as 16c (which I think it was for one room, but probably only 18c for the kids’ room – which is fine as we don’t want it to be too cold for them). With it being the winter concept, many things were closed, such as the slides and the other pools and kids aquapark. The kids club was closed, as the outdoor club just housed lots of chairs, and they made an indoor kids club, which was a very small room, with no windows, which my children found too hot. My kids just went swimming, indoors and outdoors, but if they didn't swim, there wouldn't be much to do. Also a kids disco evey night. Hana absolutely loved everything about the mini club, the facilities they offer, the face painting, the different activities planned at different times of the day, the kids shows in the evening, the mini disco every other day but most of all she loved the friendliness of the Mini club staff. Hana couldn’t stop talking about them and couldn’t wait meeting them at the end of each day in the evenings when they go on the walk through the restaurant to call children to the Mini Disco/Kids shows. Food for kids was also very very limited and everyday the same: spaghetti and mash patato. the kids club on the other hand was very nice, the animation team do their best for the children and are very kind. the kids club also very attentive. Pros - Kids club absolutely wonderful - the staff have so much energy and make each child feel special and loved (Kaira in particular was fantastic) - absolutely amazing for children and highlight of our daughters stay - she didn’t want to leave - Huge choice of tasty and fresh food - buffet open breakfast, lunch and dinner but also had toastie station, fresh pizzas and kebabs outside - Good kids and adults entertainment even in winter - different every night for adults and daily disco for kids - Lots of places to get drinks and snacks even in winter - Heated outdoor pool is glorious - Lovely spacious rooms - Friendly staff - particularly Gokhan S in the Pool Bar and the cleaning staff in the restaurant - Salon very reasonable prices Cons - Loud due to layout of rooms facing balcony into lobby - no chance of sleeping pre 11pm and even then people walk past your door and make lots of noise. It is also kid friendly so they have stations around the hotel where kids can grab a juice of choclate milk or a yogurt, not to mention the girls in Kids club, Gulistan, Doa and Melissa three amazing and outstanding grils that go out of there way to play and look after the kids in the kids club and then later in the kids disco. The kids club was closed, as the outdoor club just housed lots of chairs, and they made an indoor kids club, which was a very small room, with no windows, which my children found too hot. the kids club on the other hand was very nice, the animation team do their best for the children and are very kind. I absolutely love the fact one can spend 2 weeks without having to be disturbed by noisy children (relax pool plus adult only dining area). Two older children then came crashing down the slide in a big 8 float. The injury was actually caused by the other children crashing into me, which would not have happened if staff made sure the slide was clear before allowing others to use it. The hotel and its staff have a duty of care to its guests, particularly in an unsafe environment that is frequented by young children. Family friendly and there is a lots of things to do for children and adult. I am so happy that I chose this hotel for my children and I. My children are ages 12, 8 and 6. We enjoyed our day eating a delicious breakfast, the children were in the pools for hours, they enjoyed food, drinks and ice cream poolside. With the added bonus of the funfair (Luna park) which was enjoyed by my children. My children were in heaven! Pros - Kids club absolutely wonderful - the staff have so much energy and make each child feel special and loved (Kaira in particular was fantastic) - absolutely amazing for children and highlight of our daughters stay - she didn’t want to leave - Huge choice of tasty and fresh food - buffet open breakfast, lunch and dinner but also had toastie station, fresh pizzas and kebabs outside - Good kids and adults entertainment even in winter - different every night for adults and daily disco for kids - Lots of places to get drinks and snacks even in winter - Heated outdoor pool is glorious - Lovely spacious rooms - Friendly staff - particularly Gokhan S in the Pool Bar and the cleaning staff in the restaurant - Salon very reasonable prices Cons - Loud due to layout of rooms facing balcony into lobby - no chance of sleeping pre 11pm and even then people walk past your door and make lots of noise. The entertainment at night was professional and a lot of fun for both children, youngsters, and adults. It is the largest in terms of capacity hotel in Lara, there are four outdoor pools, one indoor pool and one children's pool. There is special care for children. We were given rooms on different floors to our children even though we booked way in advance to have the rooms next to each other. Good pools for children and adults. Yorum: Very nice hotel with a lot of facilities, especially for children. They cater for all - activities for children an adults all day every day. Ideal for people with young children. The hotel is brilliant, and I would highly recommend it for families with young children as there is plenty to do, eat and drink. as we were a family with young children, unfortunately our request was not met. The next day the receptionist told us no rooms available together - after explaining our situation ( children were scared to sleep far from us ) she managed to put 2 rooms few doors apart. Children did like the speakers blasting in their ears, so we didn't really sat in to watch any of entertainment shows. The hotel stinks of cigarette smell and there are no designated areas for smokers, you see people smoking in front of young children and walking to rooms you can smell the heavy smells of cigarettes. The buggy I was in with my children - the wheel almost fell off while riding up a rocky mountain. Yorum: We stayed at Delphin Imperial this July for our usual annual summer Antalya holiday - a family of 2 adults and 2 children. Family friendly : even if apparently is a family friendly hotel you find a lot of problems, the food is horrible for children, the water in the pools is almost toxic (all the children - no 6 - made dermatite - and if you want to go to the medical cabinet the doctor is present only on call and it will cost you 150 euro the consultation.) ; when I went to the client help office I was told that maybe the children are sensitive... The activities for children are ok. Another thing is that in April people don't travel with children so much so the hotel was very peaceful. The view was really nice, but for me, my wife and my 2 children, the room was quite small and compact. The lunapark was also closed, even though I felt it wouldn't have hurt to open for even an 1 hour a day, as there wasn't much facilities for children, but the rides were all closed. The kids club was closed, as the outdoor club just housed lots of chairs, and they made an indoor kids club, which was a very small room, with no windows, which my children found too hot. Can't fault the resort, it caters for all people especially children. I can see the amount of effort the Mini club staff put in to make sure the children have the best holiday ever! Hana couldn’t stop talking about them and couldn’t wait meeting them at the end of each day in the evenings when they go on the walk through the restaurant to call children to the Mini Disco/Kids shows. the kids club on the other hand was very nice, the animation team do their best for the children and are very kind. Children lovers.

Beach front is good also. 5 pools, just a few steps to the beach, breakfast, lunch and dinner outside on the terrace at the fresh air or in the air-conditioned interiors. If I have anything to complain about, the towels I received for the beach were sometimes dirty and even broken ... They have their private saloon,spa shopping stores, hot indoor and outdoor pools private beach everyday musical nights/cultural shows everything in the same place what more we want. Other than this, the beach, location of the hotel and people who work here are really good and friendly. Beach is quite small, just over 150 meters wide and cut in half by the big bar on the little pier like structure. There is a number of beach and pool bars with food and snacks but I didn't eat much at them. Stayed at several other hotels on lara beach stretch.

We really found it hard to beat, as we are seasoned travellers! Restaurant is huge, swimming pools are huge and sea is just a couple of minutes walk, private beach with everything you may need. And the best thing is that it doesn’t feel crowded even though there is a lot of people, there’s simply that many different venues/locations within the resort, it really feels like a small seaside town. We booked a side sea view room and wasn’t too happy with the view but we asked the hotel staff and they supported us straight away and changed our rooms the next morning to exactly what we wanted. Yorum: My stay at this hotel was truly unforgettable, thanks to the breathtaking sea views that greeted me every morning. If you're seeking a tranquil escape with unparalleled sea views, this hotel is an absolute gem. I booked this last minute with some research. The main reception and seating area is spectacular and large. odf season the hotel was still excellent. Always, at any time, something to eat and I was there in the off season. I have much more to do with the beach In this season ;) . As it was February, it is not quite a holiday season so we managed to get a good deal. Even though it was winter season there was activities during day, heated outdoor pool and evening entertainment. The beach and sea was great too. So would definitely recommend paying extra for sea view. Yorum: Just got back from the Delphin Imperial after a 4 night stay I will start with the bad first, The food in the main restaurant was awful and no mater what you tried it was cold to warm also the meals were aimed at the eastern Europeans even though an awful lot of British people were staying there, Also if you are going in peak season be ready for a find a table game as we had a right job to find one.

Great view from the balcony of the pools and the sea. We paid extra for side sea view, which was a poor view in 2 of our 3 rooms we booked. We can't wait to return in season and experience it all! Food: you will find here the cheapest and unhealthy food - we were all stomack seak (indigesty, vomited, diareea etc) 2. The season just opened then. Yorum: I visited with my family in off-season, in March. We stayed for 7 nights in the end of February 2022, and opted for a side sea view room. The lobby area was huge, with lots of seating, drinks, a patisserie bar with ice cream, a chocolate bar, places to just chill and play games. Waking up to the sound of waves and enjoying mesmerizing sunsets from the comfort of my room made the experience truly magical. Water is very nice in the morning and noon but almost every single day in evening there will be wind and waves and water will get murky and it will be difficult to swim. There were a lot of activities to choose from such as pool games, beach activities and daily evening shows organized by the hotel.

Bebekli Tatil (0-2 Yaş) için tüm sonuçlar metni: From baby pools and playgrounds to night clubs. Yorum: **Delphin Imperial Hotel Review** I recently stayed at the Delphin Imperial Hotel in Turkey with my family, and it was an outstanding experience. The kids’ club and family-friendly activities were particularly appreciated, making it easy for both kids and parents to have fun. It’s the perfect destination for a memorable family vacation in Turkey, providing enjoyment and relaxation for all ages. Family friendly and there is a lots of things to do for children and adult. This has to be the worst all inclusive i have been to, the staff have no communication skills hardly understand any english, very rude , and the guest relations is no help at all, i went with my family was totally disappointed, the food and facilities is not worth the money. My wife booked the 2 rooms for our family and the grandmother. I know if it a family friendly place but we tried to avoid any school holidays- didn't matter, there were screaming kids everywhere. Yorum: An excellent 5-star resort for you and your family. Yorum: I stayed here with my family between the dates of 28th August till 2nd September 2023. Yorum: My family and I spent 11 nights here. Highly recommend it to others, especially with a young family. Yorum: We went on a family holiday. Yorum: A wonderful experience for the family. Yorum: We stayed at Deluxe family suite, which has a great view and lots of room for kids. All in all we will 100% be back and have already recommended the hotel to friends and family. I will definitely ho here again and would recommend it 150% to any family. Yorum: We arrived 19/12/21 away for Christmas for the first time , we as a family have been to Turkey over the years , before coming to the delphin imperial not going to lie when reading some of the reviews I was slightly worried , but we had no need from start to finish could not fault the hotel. Yorum: Booked rooms for me and for my family. The family really enjoyed their stay, Ali at the Wave bar (pool bar) definitely the star on his Roller Blades, absolute star with my son Shay. had a sea view family room and the ultra all-inclusive package is out of this world. I stayed in this hotel with my family in summer 2021 and got food poisoning the third day of our vacation. Yorum: We just spent 3 nights with family and absolutely loved it. as we were a family with young children, unfortunately our request was not met. I reserved this hotel for me and my family but since my family is coming from Iran, the hotel forced us to pay 3800 euro more just due to their nationality. Yorum: We stayed at Delphin Imperial this July for our usual annual summer Antalya holiday - a family of 2 adults and 2 children. The FAMILY ROOM was lovely, and the beds are perfectly nice BUT the PILLOWS are too small and terribly lumpy. Yorum: We came as a group of 24 persons (family & friends) and I can say that overall I am very disappointed. Family friendly : even if apparently is a family friendly hotel you find a lot of problems, the food is horrible for children, the water in the pools is almost toxic (all the children - no 6 - made dermatite - and if you want to go to the medical cabinet the doctor is present only on call and it will cost you 150 euro the consultation.) ; when I went to the client help office I was told that maybe the children are sensitive... Yorum: I visited with my family in off-season, in March. Family apartments (2rooms) comfy and clean, daily cleaning. 1st class family orientated hotel. breakfast lunch Dinner the food was catered for Germans on the third day of our stay three of our family had diarrhoea the so called boiled eggs were runny not cooked and one morning were taken off all together.. Yorum: My friend's family went down to this hotel this week They booked through the hotel's website. From baby pools and playgrounds to night clubs. We have a toddler and a baby and all our needs were looked after. A doctor at the hotel claimed 120 Euros for a 5 min consultation for my 8 month baby. He did not tell us his fee before hand and then extorted money when we denied to take our baby to their hospital. Yorum: Had a really good experience for our first holiday with a baby. I absolutely love the fact one can spend 2 weeks without having to be disturbed by noisy children (relax pool plus adult only dining area). Two older children then came crashing down the slide in a big 8 float. The injury was actually caused by the other children crashing into me, which would not have happened if staff made sure the slide was clear before allowing others to use it. The hotel and its staff have a duty of care to its guests, particularly in an unsafe environment that is frequented by young children. Family friendly and there is a lots of things to do for children and adult. I am so happy that I chose this hotel for my children and I. My children are ages 12, 8 and 6. We enjoyed our day eating a delicious breakfast, the children were in the pools for hours, they enjoyed food, drinks and ice cream poolside. With the added bonus of the funfair (Luna park) which was enjoyed by my children. My children were in heaven! Pros - Kids club absolutely wonderful - the staff have so much energy and make each child feel special and loved (Kaira in particular was fantastic) - absolutely amazing for children and highlight of our daughters stay - she didn’t want to leave - Huge choice of tasty and fresh food - buffet open breakfast, lunch and dinner but also had toastie station, fresh pizzas and kebabs outside - Good kids and adults entertainment even in winter - different every night for adults and daily disco for kids - Lots of places to get drinks and snacks even in winter - Heated outdoor pool is glorious - Lovely spacious rooms - Friendly staff - particularly Gokhan S in the Pool Bar and the cleaning staff in the restaurant - Salon very reasonable prices Cons - Loud due to layout of rooms facing balcony into lobby - no chance of sleeping pre 11pm and even then people walk past your door and make lots of noise. The entertainment at night was professional and a lot of fun for both children, youngsters, and adults. It is the largest in terms of capacity hotel in Lara, there are four outdoor pools, one indoor pool and one children's pool. There is special care for children. We were given rooms on different floors to our children even though we booked way in advance to have the rooms next to each other. Good pools for children and adults. Yorum: Very nice hotel with a lot of facilities, especially for children. They cater for all - activities for children an adults all day every day. Ideal for people with young children. The hotel is brilliant, and I would highly recommend it for families with young children as there is plenty to do, eat and drink. as we were a family with young children, unfortunately our request was not met. The next day the receptionist told us no rooms available together - after explaining our situation ( children were scared to sleep far from us ) she managed to put 2 rooms few doors apart. Children did like the speakers blasting in their ears, so we didn't really sat in to watch any of entertainment shows. The hotel stinks of cigarette smell and there are no designated areas for smokers, you see people smoking in front of young children and walking to rooms you can smell the heavy smells of cigarettes. The buggy I was in with my children - the wheel almost fell off while riding up a rocky mountain. Yorum: We stayed at Delphin Imperial this July for our usual annual summer Antalya holiday - a family of 2 adults and 2 children. Family friendly : even if apparently is a family friendly hotel you find a lot of problems, the food is horrible for children, the water in the pools is almost toxic (all the children - no 6 - made dermatite - and if you want to go to the medical cabinet the doctor is present only on call and it will cost you 150 euro the consultation.) ; when I went to the client help office I was told that maybe the children are sensitive... The activities for children are ok. Another thing is that in April people don't travel with children so much so the hotel was very peaceful. The view was really nice, but for me, my wife and my 2 children, the room was quite small and compact. The lunapark was also closed, even though I felt it wouldn't have hurt to open for even an 1 hour a day, as there wasn't much facilities for children, but the rides were all closed. The kids club was closed, as the outdoor club just housed lots of chairs, and they made an indoor kids club, which was a very small room, with no windows, which my children found too hot. Can't fault the resort, it caters for all people especially children. I can see the amount of effort the Mini club staff put in to make sure the children have the best holiday ever! Hana couldn’t stop talking about them and couldn’t wait meeting them at the end of each day in the evenings when they go on the walk through the restaurant to call children to the Mini Disco/Kids shows. the kids club on the other hand was very nice, the animation team do their best for the children and are very kind. Children lovers.

Spa and Wellness için tüm sonuçlar metni: Yorum: The all-inclusive package was great From indulging in rejuvenating spa services to relishing an array of delectable food options, the hotel provided a comprehensive and satisfying holiday experience. The spa and sauna center is good and with plenty of options. - Downstairs shop a rip off - €5 for a kids lollipop - Spa is very expensive and not good - 50 min facial included 30 mins of lying with a face mask on in the incredibly noisy spa - A La carte food very average and tiny portions but waiters lovely (Zuma) - Duvets far too small for beds and soaking wet robes left in the room and not changed. We stayed here for a week and loved every bit from the atmosphere of the place, to the friendly staff, the spa area and not to mention the great huge variety in food. It is by far, the biggest and most beautiful SPA I have ever seen. The spa seemed nice enough, and there were even a few medium sized water park slides, which was a great addition! There is also a little rides section for the kids in the evening as well as access to spa facilities such as sauna and steam room and hammamt. Nice SPA and heated swimming pool. Right from the customer service to food from everyday activities to dj night to cinema to kids activities to hamam and spa things one of the best resort i ever seen. The SPA was nice – but we were a little disappointed with the overly pushy male presence there. The spa area was really good too, with steam room, saunas and hammam. Massage is rubbish don't waste your money best to look for private massage as it's cheaper and better 102. Went for a full body massage an it was amazing!!! After that massage my body was super relax. Dont rent a car from the resort you can book uber to save more money😉 lastly never miss the chance of hamam and massage dont book in this resort try to book from the tourist guide he ll give u the best cheaper deals. Single massage costs half of my daily stay, no thank you. The spa and sauna center is good and with plenty of options. There are multiple saunas, gorgeous hammams, dazzling steam baths, comfy relax rooms with cool Zen music and superb decoration. There is also a little rides section for the kids in the evening as well as access to spa facilities such as sauna and steam room and hammamt. Food, drinks, heated pools, saunas, service were superb.

Ps: if you are retired or someone who wanna visit for relaxation plan on jan or feb its really cheap inclusive flights from london for a wk approx 180-190quid😂 best deals can get from love holidays must book from here keep an eye they have the best deals😍 would give 9.5/10. We had travel insurance, but the hospital expect money upfront before any treatment. This trip was a source of great apprehension for my mother and me, as it's the first time we've traveled with him in such a frail state of health. After speaking to reception staff about my husband's health they did leave hand gels in rooms, which we were already using. Food: you will find here the cheapest and unhealthy food - we were all stomack seak (indigesty, vomited, diareea etc) 2. There are multiple saunas, gorgeous hammams, dazzling steam baths, comfy relax rooms with cool Zen music and superb decoration. There is also a little rides section for the kids in the evening as well as access to spa facilities such as sauna and steam room and hammamt. The spa area was really good too, with steam room, saunas and hammam. The only missing thing is a jacuzzi in the pool. Balcony is huge and there is a jacuzzi at the balcony. We were upgraded to a deluxe room with a jacuzzi, so that was amazing My only suggestion would be if there was a prayer facility for guests, then that would be perfect But we had an amazing time, so thank you, Delphin Imperial 130. There is also a little rides section for the kids in the evening as well as access to spa facilities such as sauna and steam room and hammamt.

Özel Menü için tüm sonuçlar metni: emailed this hotel what vegan options they have. there is NO VEGAN food in this hotel. I don't think they even know what vegan is... If you are vegetarian there will be less food options for you. We had a few vegetarians in our group who only ate fruit for the 7 days that we were there despite there being so much food choice and having paid a lot to stay at this property. They refused to understand what vegetarianism is serving food with chicken to vegetarians. Refused to make special food for the vegetarians even in the A la carte restaurants. 6 Ala carte restaurants were open however you need to book it in advance to get reservation, we did not use Ala carte as there was not much vegetarian option. They need to work on the menus where it should say vegetarian so people like me who never eat meat is easy for us to eat any stuff wd d sign like VE/V. Whether you prefer international cuisine or local Turkish specialties, the quality and flavor of the meals are consistently excellent. The waiters were overly clingy, making it difficult to enjoy our meals in peace. The food was very repetitive with limited options and the drinks were very sugary and even after paying a high charge for an all inclusive package we had to go out for meals. Had 3 Al a carte meals all superb went for Chinese on b'day got presented with gorgeous big cake waiters turned off lights n sang to me. Yorum: Just got back from the Delphin Imperial after a 4 night stay I will start with the bad first, The food in the main restaurant was awful and no mater what you tried it was cold to warm also the meals were aimed at the eastern Europeans even though an awful lot of British people were staying there, Also if you are going in peak season be ready for a find a table game as we had a right job to find one. For main meals, the buffet was relatively good - although some dishes weren't amazing, for every meal there were some very good options.

Parti Deneyimi için tüm sonuçlar metni: One evening we stumbled across the launch party of Delphin's first party of the year!... and what a party it was! I gave 4 stars because they do party and loud music until 11pm or sometimes until before midnight. During the daytime, there was a Hawaii party and everyone (all ages) was dancing and having a good time. The tour company koral is not linked to the hotel and a third party company sent through your hotel booking company. On Christmas party at the noon, when I tried to talked with senior manager, when he noticed I am not going to admire him, he started to talk with other, that means your voice is not important. I gave 4 stars because they do party and loud music until 11pm or sometimes until before midnight. There are multiple saunas, gorgeous hammams, dazzling steam baths, comfy relax rooms with cool Zen music and superb decoration. The entertainment it was quite good but we preferred the lounge area with the live music. The romantic illuminated pier, drinks and music in the evening is a must-see. They have their private saloon,spa shopping stores, hot indoor and outdoor pools private beach everyday musical nights/cultural shows everything in the same place what more we want. They had evening entertainment which was really good, and even had live music every night. Right from the customer service to food from everyday activities to dj night to cinema to kids activities to hamam and spa things one of the best resort i ever seen.

Gece Eğlence Programı için tüm sonuçlar metni: Night entertainment is very impressive, although it is very loud until midnight so that might not be ideal for light sleepers. From engaging daytime activities to captivating evening shows, they ensured that guests of all ages were entertained and having a great time. There were a lot of activities to choose from such as pool games, beach activities and daily evening shows organized by the hotel. Every evening shows on the stage outside and everything is beautifully lit. One minus for evening shows, which I assess lack sufficient appeal. On our last visit, our daughter Hana was very small, so we didn’t make use of the mini club and evening shows that much, but now that she is a bit older we decided to try it out and we were so happy we did! The entertainment it was quite good but we preferred the lounge area with the live music. They had evening entertainment which was really good, and even had live music every night.

Then a great gym to work off those extra calories too! I’m giving it 4* sadly because the rooms and bathrooms just don’t have the same wow factor as the rest of the hotel, and the gym is very small compared to the one in Delphin BE grand, with limited machines. It has shops, barbers, a spa, bowling and arcade, nightclub, a gym, swimming pool, cinema, doctor clinic and a Camelot Bar, all in one building which is amazing!!! All the the employees are professional and special thanks to Omar the gym trainer .
