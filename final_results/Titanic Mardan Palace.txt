Fantastic kids club. The hotel offers plenty of entertainment for children, including one of the best kids' clubs we've ever been to (and we've had a lot of them) - a separate area with its own show programs that don't overlap with adult events. There is also a very good kids club, the girls are animators who love their work. The tiny kids club was very good. The only down side is that the entertainment went down a bit, but the kids club is also the best we've seen. We have had various experiences with the Kids-Club. They have a lot of different pools but it takes a while to get to the kids pool and everyone on the beach is scammed so please avoid them. This is the first time we have used the kids club, our 8 year old twins loved it, it was enough to keep them occupied when the sun came out in the afternoon, the art and ceramics workshops were amazing. Dileck was amazing with them, I have to mention another member of staff Esra who was a superstar and a real credit to the kids club team, I felt my kids were safe, stimulated and comfortable while we were able to enjoy the rest for the adults. The water park served its purpose, but I feel that on any future trip here, my kids will want bigger slides than the nearby resorts. My son who is 4 years old really enjoyed the kids facilities. Special thanks to Tini Kids Club, especially Diana in the Art Studio for helping my daughter develop her painting skills!

Lots of fun for kids and adults alike. The pools are amazing, huge, we've never seen them this big. The pool is simply stunning!!! On the point, from the dispenser in the pool and beach and from the bottle in the lobby, and in the Shiller cafe, juices are available per portion and most people do not understand English. The water in the pool is a bit cold. Among these hotels, overall, Titanic Mardan ranks last in our preference, but it is a very good hotel, value for money compared to many hotels, but below the above mentioned, it has many positive aspects, such as Amon spa, white sand on the beach, rooms are luxurious, lobby is luxurious and unique, beautiful terrace, good food, comfortable chairs on the beach and in the pool, but at the point you don't really get to the water, who doesn't rent a cabin, except at the end. Good a la carte food at Stella and Savor, with excellent pizza, the best coffee in the hotels, excellent music at the pool, especially in the evening, and a dreamy atmosphere with lights and beautiful views, especially from the tower. | The pool tile falls and the ‚Ä¶ 13.

Plus, the pool view, cabana options, beach, and entertainment were all very enjoyable. We were very happy that the hotel was big and there was no fight for places in the pool or by the sea. Yorum: Titanic Mardan Palace offers a magnificent palace atmosphere that embodies splendor and true luxury with its elegant design, where Seljuk and Ottoman architecture meets modern comfort, its central location decorated with works of art in every corner, large comfortable rooms to meet all needs, sumptuous views and large pool areas. Adults only must enter the dining room and pool. Why they insist on pumping club music around the pool for 9 hours a day I have no idea it's not necessary. The rooms are cleaned daily and the fridges are stocked daily Premium drinks are available which are taken by the skate bar staff The pool is huge and spacious sabrina helped us book our La cart restaurant and went out of her way to help us with a few things. Ordering drinks at the pool was a challenge - staff seemed demotivated and even rude at times. The neighborhood is beautiful with a swimming pool. Comment: Excellent hotel, clean, very chic, huge pools, clean warm water üëç, evening concerts, discos are great! It is a very big pool and there is a small children's pool. The place is so old, real mold in the pool, air conditioning in the rooms doesn't work. Amazing swimming pools, water parks, private beach. The pool is fantastic. Poolside bar staff come on roller skates and take your order so you never have to leave your seat. Probably the biggest swimming pools in Europe are here. The waiters are attentive and friendly, fast and attentive, the menu is wide, the pools are big and more than enough, the hotel is very big, a bit tiring, but that's a negative on the positive side :) 77. There were always sunbeds and the pool, plenty of towels for the sunbeds. The spa was so luxurious with beautiful pools, relaxation rooms and saunas. On the negative side, there was too much sand on the pool floor and we could see oils on the water. The cleaning of the pool could be better. The music playing in the pool is also terrible :) Other than that, the food, drinks, sunbeds and water sports were very good. There were also few competition and entertainment programs by the pool, and it would have been better to have more fun programs by the pool during the day. The rooms and pools are very good, I think the only shortcoming is that the lighting in the rooms is very weak and the connecting door of the silo rooms is not closed. Arda, Kuzey and Doƒüan at the Pool Bar, whose names I remember, Mr. The pools are large and refreshingly cold. They have a lot of different pools but it takes a while to get to the kids pool and everyone on the beach is scammed so please avoid them. The pools were huge, which is a plus because you don't have to stick directly to others. The sunbeds at the pool were also very clean and comfortable. they are friendly, they know their jobs well: in the Bosphorous-Gul restaurant, in the Stella-Mehmed restaurant and in the Samagat pool service. From the food to the hotel rooms and the pools, they were all very nice. The hotel is very nice, there are many decorative pools.. This was a last minute holiday, a family of 4 were looking for a chilled pool holiday and it provided exactly that. We stayed in a deluxe pool view room, it was more than big enough for 2 adults and 8 year old twins, the room was comfortable, nicely decorated and the amazing maid kept it clean before we even got back from breakfast. We had no problem with the sunbeds, plenty of choice after breakfast, especially at the cafe end of the pool, the waiters at the pool are brilliant, they looked after us every day and made a real fuss of our children who they loved, Mustafa in particular was excellent. The pool was missing tiles in several places, it didn't affect our stay and I'm sure it's a lot of work to replace them and we'll be doing it over the winter months, but it needs some TLC. The toilet in the hall and where the pool was was very dirty. Huge pool and next to the sea. The restaurant has very delicious food, especially "Stella snack" and "Mardan bistro" very nice rooms and villas, and most of the hotel is water, the spa has many pools, it is very cool and warm. Plenty of programs for adults, water polo, aqua spinning, trampoline jumping in the pool, darts. The pool party was like being in Ibiza, it was fantastic üëå The evening shows are fun. The swim up pool bar was my favorite, the super bar man made the best cocktails! The pool and beach are well maintained and provide a perfect environment for relaxation. The pool is clean with plenty of sunbeds and the beach is only a short walk away with stunning views and crystal clear water. The room overlooks the pool, with evening sun. The service is good, especially in the lobby and by the pool. The water in the sea is about 1-2 degrees colder than in the neighboring hotels, because the mouth of the Lara River is right at the Titanic Mardan beach, although we did not feel any pollution.

Yoga and pilates classes were simply wonderful, I enjoyed going every morning) The whole family played darts, which I really liked, played water polo, volleyball and boccia (all the animators were positive, it was pleasant to talk with them, enthusiastic, in general the time passed interestingly and I didn't realize how quickly 21 days passed). Amazing swimming pools, water parks, private beach. On the negative side, there was too much sand on the pool floor and we could see oils on the water. The music playing in the pool is also terrible :) Other than that, the food, drinks, sunbeds and water sports were very good. There is a large river nearby and the water is green if there are no waves bringing fresh water from the sea. We rented a tent on the pier during the day, we were there in July and the water was good. There were very nice activities, especially water polo, volleyball and soccer, I am thinking of coming again. The water park served its purpose, but I feel that on any future trip here, my kids will want bigger slides than the nearby resorts. The restaurant has very delicious food, especially "Stella snack" and "Mardan bistro" very nice rooms and villas, and most of the hotel is water, the spa has many pools, it is very cool and warm. water bars have many different Doritos drinks and salty chips.

However, you have to be careful not to be ripped off by taxi drivers. We have a great time and are constantly busy with both sports and entertainment. There is a bowling alley, and the children's animation will keep the kids busy! When we voiced our concerns, he essentially told us, "We have enough guests without you." As a businessman myself, I would heartily fire him for this kind of behavior. My daughter loved the cinema and arcades, although it would be worth getting a couple more as they can be busy at times. However, there is plenty to keep you busy and entertained. The service is mostly very good, there are staff who obviously lack either training or perhaps enthusiasm, but they generally take good care of you. The fact that she is a woman, more than a person working in the service sector, has a disgusting attitude, talks to me without restraint, claims that she is the highest ranking person in the hotel and stubbornly does not let me meet anyone. The location of the hotel is very convenient.

The hotel is simply beautiful, big, the area is huge and beautiful. The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hotel is large. Especially in the SPA area and the beef restaurant. The hotel area is very easy to navigate. Quality from the rooms to the food and entertainment.||What stood out was the service and politeness throughout the hotel, except for the usual bartender in the night show area.||The ‚Ä¶ 50. The only thing that spoiled the vacation was the fact that there were lots of hungry cats in the area. When choosing the hotel, I was guided by many positive reviews, so I knew that the hotel would not disappoint, but it exceeded all our expectations: a huge area, a lot of greenery, guest assistants who solve all problems as quickly as possible. The hotel offers plenty of entertainment for children, including one of the best kids' clubs we've ever been to (and we've had a lot of them) - a separate area with its own show programs that don't overlap with adult events. The visible areas were always clean, but the hidden areas (see pictures) from day one! Overall it was a pleasant stay, but there are plenty of hotels in the area that offer better value for money. The area where the performances take place is very poorly furnished. In general, the rooms and common areas of the hotel were clean. The toilets in the common areas were not cleaned... Especially in the SPA area and the beef restaurant. We booked a cabana on the beach for three days, it was very relaxing and it was great to have a nice shaded area for my daughter. We have been to many places in the world, but for us right now this place is in the first place. Great place! I have never been to a place where the place looks exactly like the pictures, if not better. If you want a relaxing stay with beautiful weather and a luxurious feel, this is the ideal place! We were very happy that the hotel was big and there was no fight for places in the pool or by the sea. Comment: We chose this hotel as the meeting place for our parents as we all live in different countries. Comment: We chose this hotel as the meeting place for our parents as we all live in different countries. Like Mard√°n, who didn't even bother to listen to his grandmother and ruined my vacation, I was very saddened that such a person was placed in this position in such a corporate place. Comment: The place is absolutely amazing and the last word is "terrible", they were of good quality and very fantastic and each dish is more distinct than the other with its dishes impressing more than the last. Comment: I don't understand why this place hasn't been sued for a scam like this before. The place is so old, real mold in the pool, air conditioning in the rooms doesn't work. This place makes you feel like you never want to leave. It was the perfect place to relax and unwind in a peaceful environment. Comment: It was a great experience for us, the food at the hotel was very good, especially the lasagna and baklava were excellent, far superior to many other places I have eaten. |I am a young man, 30 years old, and I wanted to shave my head, beard and ear hair.|Usually from 10‚Ç¨ to a maximum of 30‚Ç¨ in a luxury place. You can feel that you have arrived at a truly quality place. This is a beautiful and wonderful place. The area where the performances take place is very poorly furnished. Comment: Titanic Mardan Palace is an impressive place not only with its sports facilities, but also with its location. Comment: The Titanic Mardan Palace Hotel is the ideal place for an unforgettable vacation in luxurious conditions on the picturesque sea shore. I recommend this place to everyone who wants to spend time comfortably, safely and happily. The pool was missing tiles in several places, it didn't affect our stay and I'm sure it's a lot of work to replace them and we'll be doing it over the winter months, but it needs some TLC. Would recommend this place to everyone. Two soccer fields, a tennis court and a volleyball court, there are many places for different age groups, for example, for children 4-10 years old "Teen club" for children 11-16 years old "Teenage club" for over 18 years old "Mykonos club" many activities for everyone. The staff here really make this place paradise.

Comment: A positive thing is the very attentive and friendly staff, who immediately offered us a room upgrade without asking because of our baby, as the standard rooms are apparently small. Cleanliness, programs, children have everything they want. A must-see hotel in Antalya Extremely suitable, especially for families with children. The beach walk was quite long, which can be a bit tiring with children.

What is missing is a restaurant on the beach with sofas and a DJ like Ela excellence or Calista, and this would be a concept worthy of Mardan Palace's reputation. Comment: The complex is very big, nice beach, but there are not enough sunbeds, which are booked right before breakfast. Plus, the pool view, cabana options, beach, and entertainment were all very enjoyable. I liked everything, food, drinks, beach, service. The only minus is that you have to walk 15 minutes from the beach to the reception on a very large and not very bumpy road. The beach walk was quite long, which can be a bit tiring with children. It's certainly perfect for couples or solo travelers, but families might want to consider a longer walk along the beach.

They have a lot of different pools but it takes a while to get to the kids pool and everyone on the beach is scammed so please avoid them. The beach was generally very nice, but there were too few sunbeds, which was very annoying. You can see that this hotel is trying to squeeze more money out of people's pockets as it is a strategy that rents out more of these beach houses. I would not like to come to this hotel again, just because of the position of the sunbeds on the beach. What I didn't like were the umbrellas on the beach that couldn't be closed, so you always had to move the deckchairs, which are very heavy, back and forth.

The water in the sea is about 1-2 degrees colder than in the neighboring hotels, because the mouth of the Lara River is right at the Titanic Mardan beach, although we did not feel any pollution. We were very happy that the hotel was big and there was no fight for places in the pool or by the sea. The sea and sand are beautiful and the bottom does not sink The hotel has a beautiful design, especially the palace design in the lobby. Access to the sea is not the best, the water is dirty. Comment: Exceptional hospitality that seamlessly combines luxury and comfort. The sea is incomparable! The quality of the food is top notch - from fresh seafood to delicious desserts. Poolside bar staff come on roller skates and take your order so you never have to leave your seat. on the first floor, overlooking the sea. Yorum: In short, everything is great, but the sea sucks. There is a large river nearby and the water is green if there are no waves bringing fresh water from the sea. The restaurant always had good outdoor seating. It is questionable how it is during the whole high season, when there are even more guests in the hotel. Its sea view and luxurious atmosphere are ideal for relaxing and having a good time. Comment: The Titanic Mardan Palace Hotel is the ideal place for an unforgettable vacation in luxurious conditions on the picturesque sea shore. Huge pool and next to the sea. There is a large river nearby and the water is green if there are no waves bringing fresh water from the sea.

Parti Deneyimi i√ßin t√ºm sonu√ßlar metni: The pool party was like being in Ibiza, it was fantastic üëå The evening shows are fun. If you like active relaxation and partying, you will love this hotel! Sometimes I miss the music on the beach. Very good tasting cakes, good 24 hour restaurant, but the quality of the menu is not the same as Ela's more varied Didiscoteca, with good music and beautiful shows. Good a la carte food at Stella and Savor, with excellent pizza, the best coffee in the hotels, excellent music at the pool, especially in the evening, and a dreamy atmosphere with lights and beautiful views, especially from the tower. We would like to say a special thank you to the animation girl Veronika, who created a very friendly and cheerful atmosphere in all the activities we attended, a wonderful program and I especially liked the live music. Why they insist on pumping club music around the pool for 9 hours a day I have no idea it's not necessary. Help with trips, tips for organizing leisure activities outside the hotel, extensive evening program, live music. The evening program is very good, there is live music and shows, a themed disco. He helped with excursions, gave advice on leisure activities outside the hotel, a wide evening program, live music. Now they just play music through a stereo system. The only downside is the nightclub as the music can't be beat at times as it's very heavy house and dance music, no known songs which meant people went home early and you couldn't really dance to it. The music playing in the pool is also terrible :) Other than that, the food, drinks, sunbeds and water sports were very good. I just found it really boring because there wasn't any decent music or anything like that. The music at the parties was always the same and bad. We also enjoyed the live music in the lobby, to be honest, it would be nice to have live music all day - it really lifts the mood. The steak restaurant, on the other hand, is excellent, its decoration, atmosphere and live music make the extra charge worth it. In the evening there are wonderful parties and performances with music and dancing. What is missing is a restaurant on the beach with sofas and a DJ like Ela excellence or Calista, and this would be a concept worthy of Mardan Palace's reputation. My children were delighted with the variety of activities - from beach parties to exciting DJ parties. In the evening there are wonderful parties and performances with music and dancing. Lots of fun activities for all ages. fun activities and good and cool animators!

The gym is super well equipped with machines, which is very rare! There is everything from morning gymnastics to evening mini discos and children's programs. The gym is well equipped but could open earlier as the early risers were a bit late at 8am.
