Good food, swimming pool and beach at the top üëç A big thank you to Senay Canbolat and Irina Sosnina who are very friendly and who gave us good advice on what to visit in Antalya. Yorum: Not at all satisfied, the room is average, no entertainment at all (adults and children), the food not very good, always the same thing, we couldn't find a table, too many people, not enough deckchairs on the beach, the hotel hosted several sports tournaments, lots of young people who don't sleep until the morning and make a lot of noise, we couldn't sit at the bar or in the hall because there was no space and lack of manners. Yorum: Beautiful hotel, has a large accommodation capacity, good all day food, activity, the beach is very beautiful, I recommend this hotel!! Beautiful private beach. Yorum: There is no games room, no billiards, no mini golf etc., I am very disappointed, and the rest is very good the swimming pool is beautiful, the sea and opposite the rooms are good the shows very good, but there is no games room or billiards that is very sad 8. The sea a few meters away with private beach. Yorum: -little entertainment, some refuse children altogether -bars open at very unsuitable times, shame -dilapidated rooms (light that doesn't work in the bathrooms, cracks, stairs with paint stains, shower without seal = swimming pool in the bathroom) - we booked a room for 5, when we arrived we found 4 beds so they added 1 bed on the fly which is a shame given the price - entertainment not entertaining or even worthless 34. Yorum: The hotel is magnificent, facing the sea, the atmosphere is great, the staff is super welcoming, the best!! My room had a front row seat. Several activities available: swimming pools with slide, sea "feet in the water", various evenings every night with diverse troupes of musicians. Year: Furkan Sinem Sahin Berat and the whole team at the seafood restaurant are great. Beach with beautiful waves and ideal temperature.

Yorum: Hotel nickel hotel staff o TOP impeccable cleanliness but when it comes to going out you have to ask for a taxi at reception and there the whole network is set up do not leave the hotel real crooks taxi restaurant guy from the hotel reception pfff 57. Yorum: The +: close to the airport, access and beach and swimming pool facilities are great. I highly recommend this hotel, its staff, its location, its climate, its meals and its logistics. -smiling and friendly staff - excellent and very varied food - Very large swimming pool - Very pretty beach - Entertainment - location - very clean hotel The negative point (if I may say so) are the rooms. the beach is beautiful the swimming pool too only downside the location is very isolated and no wifi in the rooms.. Yorum: The hotel itself is good despite the fact that the opening hours for the aquatic area (slides) are really restrictive 10am-12pm and 2pm-4pm.|The real downside of this hotel is clearly the staff who are rude, not helpful at all‚Ä¶ 6. Yorum: Hello everyone, very nice hotel, very luxurious, nice area, cool and pleasant for families, it's 5 stars, well done 75. Yorum: A little expensive for a hotel of this type but in the average price range for this geographical area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city (Lara) 91. The rooms are old, no more than 2 sockets per room and what's more, they are poorly placed. Unforgettable memories in an unforgettable place 13. Additionally, we were placed at a table far from the entertainment. The spa is a very beautiful place and the massages are adapted to each person and very effective. Very well maintained place, never any trash on the ground, I really recommend it 36. Yorum: Kremlin palace is a wonderful place for little ones! Yorum: An exceptional place that I highly recommend for a leisure and restful stay. Yorum: Miniclub children very nice place for children with lots of colors and decorations suitable for children as well as staff. Yorum: Beautiful place, very friendly staff. Yorum: Great place.
