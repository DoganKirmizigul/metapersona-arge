Exceptional swimming pool and spa. Comment: It is a very small hotel, the rooms are very narrow, there is no water in the bathroom and it flows very little. Comment: The hotel is normal for 3 stars, you can live there, the water is weak and lukewarm, there is no hot water. The water pressure in the room on the first floor was very weak. A guy came and did something to the unit and all this dirty black water came out. There was no water in the shower and many things were broken and missing, making it impossible to use the shower properly. The water was not draining and there was hair in the drain. The rooms are small (but it doesn't matter), cleaned every day (towels, bathroom accessories (shampoo, shower gel, body cream), water - changed every day). The water flow in the shower is barely running (a girl washing her hair‚Ä¶ 118. Beds are made, bottles of drinking water are brought every day, shampoo and washing gels are brought every 2-3 days.

Breakfast was also pretty good but there were few seats. After a few minutes the sea can be seen.

Spa and Wellness i√ßin t√ºm sonu√ßlar metni: Use of the spa requires an agreement with the sister hotel opposite - it should be free! The room we eventually got was extremely small and sauna-like, the window faced a wall and outside the window were cigarettes and empty boxes from previous hotel guests. Comment: Great service, very good treatment by staff. Comment: The carpet in the room is completely dirty, the breakfast buffet leaves much to be desired, the treatment of the staff is terrible, definitely not recommended, we will never return!
