The pool was good, the sea was very pebbly, pebbles, the evening entertainment programs were not very good, the theater area was very dominant, they are turning the dining hall into a performance area anyway, there was no variety in the a la carte restaurant, it was as if they were serving the food in the buffet (except for lahmacun) only to your plate.

While our room was being prepared, we took a short walk around the pool and had the opportunity to have some drinks and snacks. Pools: There is one inside, one outside and a large pool that covers the entire area in front of the hotel, as well as a relatively quieter pool on the side of the hotel. There is also a pool area designed for small children where small children can easily enter the water. The average temperature of the outdoor pools is 26-27 degrees, while the indoor pools are colder, so it is good to cool off by going in during the day. There are enough sun loungers by the pool. The pool is vacuumed every day and all sun loungers are arranged and wiped down before 8:30.

From the first minute we arrived until the last minute we left, all the hotel staff were very helpful in their part of the business. The waiters and busboys are working hard. Comment: I had a wonderful holiday,|The hotel is a professional business from top to bottom.|I would like to thank Mr. We thank your business for everything 42. At the same time, a valet took our car to their parking lot right next to the hotel. Although I wish they had a parking lot that was completely covered or had more shade, our vehicles would have been protected from both the dust and dirt and our vehicle would have been protected from the Antalya sun. But since many guests arrived by plane, the parking area may have been left in the background while the hotel was being built. In a perfect location. The hotel is very good in terms of location, food and service. The sea also begins to deepen at the ideal distance. I have stayed in 3 hotels in that area before. The pool was good, the sea was very pebbly, pebbles, the evening entertainment programs were not very good, the theater area was very dominant, they are turning the dining hall into a performance area anyway, there was no variety in the a la carte restaurant, it was as if they were serving the food in the buffet (except for lahmacun) only to your plate. Bars and dining areas are spread throughout the property and offer excellent service. At the hotel door, our luggage was carefully unloaded from the vehicle and taken to the waiting area until we checked in. But since many guests arrived by plane, the parking area may have been left in the background while the hotel was being built. Reception: When you enter the hotel, you are greeted by a magnificent reception and waiting area. In the same area, right across from the entrance, cool drinks (lemonade, various Ottoman-inspired sherbets and chilled champagne for those who wish) are served to guests. Pools: There is one inside, one outside and a large pool that covers the entire area in front of the hotel, as well as a relatively quieter pool on the side of the hotel. There is also a pool area designed for small children where small children can easily enter the water. But I recommend you not to reserve a sunbed before 8.30 because during the cleaning, they take your belongings and leave them in the towel area.

The employee named was very interested and concerned, he took care of us as if we had gone to his home, not as a workplace. For all meals, you can find a comfortable place to sit, either indoors or outdoors. Above all else, the place where my children and I were happiest was the kids' club. Comment: A place you will never give up on once you come and one that truly deserves the service. One of the places you will not regret... A place we will never give up on going :) 46.

Its private beach is large enough for all its guests. The beach is generally made up of sand, so you don't need sea shoes. The beverage carts on the beach are also well positioned for those who want to cool off. It was also a nice gesture to gift my wife a beach bag and our daughters a small bag.
