I spent over 3 hours over 3 days trying to book the property over the phone, the prices quoted by the reservation teams were sometimes 3 times the advertised price on the IC website, every time we called a different price was quoted, and staff were extremely unhelpful and rude. Furthermore, the staff were ignorant of the property and could not tell us if the property had access to the hotel facilities and what was included. But once at the hotel the staff were much friendlier, the innkeeper was much more accommodating, welcomed us with flowers on arrival and was able to accommodate our specific needs, so I would like to extend a special thank you and appreciation to her (I forget her name but she was Russian and wore a pink suit) Nevertheless, we had a great stay, would definitely recommend the hotel and no doubt these small issues will be rectified eventually.

The main restaurant is great, good service and they make extra dishes for the grandchildren.

Ideal for those with children as it is located next to the Green Palace which has many facilities for children including many water slides and features, a fantastic kids club with lots of activities every day and several pools. The many water slides and the children's pool there were also perfect, and every day it was a struggle in the late afternoon to go home for a shower ;-) Last but not least.

The many water slides and the children's pool there were also perfect, and every day it was a struggle in the late afternoon to go home for a shower ;-) Last but not least. If I may just say, add a waiter to the beach restaurant because the 2 waitresses are a bit overwhelmed‚Ä¶ and I also think that the age of the children (over 10) for the slides is a bit exaggerated if they are accompanied by their parents because I want you to count on safety, but it has to be everywhere‚Ä¶ because there is no lifeguard at the swimming pool in the residence.. Our choice of a beach villa was ideal ‚Äì it was beautifully maintained, offered a private pool for splashy fun, and even came with a dedicated cabana on the beach for ultimate relaxation. the villas are luxuriously equipped with direct access to a super pool. Yorum: An excellent hotel for a family holiday.|We stayed in the lakeside villa, the villa was very comfortable, spacious rooms, 2 bathrooms, comfortable terraces by the pool. We traveled as two families together and stayed in the Lake Villas first which was great - with direct access to a super pool and large rooms with everything you need. |What we didn't like about the Residense area was the food.|- The pool service only worked sometimes. The pool is large and clean, the beach bar always has something good to eat, the restaurant is quiet, well stocked... We stayed in a Bali Junior villa with private pool. We stayed at the Lake Villas, a fantastic room with access to the pool. We started at the Lake Villas which are very nice and spacious with direct access to a great pool. The pools and slides were great fun and there are loads of activities for the kids. We love the place, gardens, pools, beach, entertainment, but best of all, all the people who work there hard and always kind, very friendly. The pools, the water slides, the entertainment were all fantastic. Luxurious hotel, excellent villa, convenient access to the pool. A private restaurant, pools, attentive waiters, lots of greenery. Our choice of a beach villa was ideal ‚Äì it was beautifully maintained, offered a private pool for splashy fun, and even came with a dedicated cabana on the beach for ultimate relaxation. Access to the lagoon pool is brilliant and it rarely gets busy. Many bars and cafes are scattered around the beach and pools with a variety of options to supply you with water, fresh juice and ice cream. Bali one is a nice house with its own pool and small garden, larger rooms, and special rooms. Ideal for those with children as it is located next to the Green Palace which has many facilities for children including many water slides and features, a fantastic kids club with lots of activities every day and several pools. Nice rooms with private pool with pool terrace and good cleaning every day and well-stocked minibar. Also a quiet swimming pool a little further from the Residence section. The 2 bedroom rooms were perfect with direct access to the pool. The many water slides and the children's pool there were also perfect, and every day it was a struggle in the late afternoon to go home for a shower ;-) Last but not least. In 2022 we were welcomed outside by the pool when we arrived with champagne and cocktails. Please note that only 2 of all the pools in the whole resort are heated (water park and indoor pool), I'm sure this is not a problem in summer but in April all the other pools were far too cold and were such a shame to have a pool villa with a pool that was too cold to use. We could not use the lake pool much, probably because no one used it, because it smelled a bit, but the communal pool of the residence was very nice among the flowers. The "Villa Poolsite" category is apartments with two bedrooms and a small living room right next to the communal pool. Our family traveling with us had a beautiful view over a staircase and also no direct access to the pool. At least on the fourth day of the holiday we managed to get at least the family we were traveling with to get a slightly better room (not a villa) with direct access to the pool. many pools, but they all have the same depth and shape. Comment: Excellent hotel, beautiful swimming pools, possibility to use the infrastructure of the neighboring hotel (Green Palace). The pools and sea were very clean and refreshing. time now and it only seems to get better.|Beautiful swimming pools and no need for a towel.|Great food and amazing staff!|See you next time!!|| 75. The residence (Lake Villa Poolside with direct access to the pool on the top floor) creates total Corona safety and you still have social contacts. Our villa (number 5035) has a great location for the pool and the sun. The pool is not heated, but we can swim very well in it. We almost always have the large pool at Spy-Bag Restaurant to ourselves. There are great pools for children at IC Green Palace. Comment: Lovely apartment with lovely (private) swimming pool and good food!! In July it is high season and the hotel seems to be booked early from Russia; as initially I wanted a villa with a private pool, but all were booked. * The swimming pool in front of the Residence reception is very relaxing and quiet. We were 4 adults and a child and had a beautiful apartment complex with access to the pool. Whether it's a restaurant or a pool, there's always an attentive gem present. We stayed in the quiet and peaceful Lake Villa (Duplex), which had access to a shared pool with 2 bedrooms and a living room. The villa was spacious and kept to a good standard daily and the pool was perfect for us for a morning swim. The benefits of the residence include things like access to the wonderful Mavi restaurant (large selection of food with a more refined elegance) and 24-hour bar, plunge pool, relaxation sauna and hammam area as well as a carriage on duty which has never been available. We booked 6 nights at the residence, as soon as we arrived we were upgraded to a perfect villa with a private pool. The only downside is that the pools are cold in September and not one pool is heated. Heated pool + for children.

Yorum: Luxury villa with private pool and minibar that is refilled more than daily! Comment: Service, picturesque surrounding areas, many swimming pools, Show, excellent fusion cuisine. Comment: It may be preferred because of the pools 163. We have been looking for a long time for where to go;|- near the airport|- first line with sandy beach |- ultra all inclusive |- water park... The pools, the water slides, the entertainment were all fantastic. Comment: It is a very peaceful and isolated environment If you want, you can go to the Green Palace side and do water and all kinds of activities. The on-site water park and kids club were a big hit with my family, providing endless hours of entertainment. What makes this hotel outstanding and somewhat unique in Antalya is that all activities and entertainment, water park, kids club, evening entertainment are next door at Green Palace, but you can then return to the sanctuary of the residence. Many bars and cafes are scattered around the beach and pools with a variety of options to supply you with water, fresh juice and ice cream. Ideal for those with children as it is located next to the Green Palace which has many facilities for children including many water slides and features, a fantastic kids club with lots of activities every day and several pools. a hotel for those who come for a comfortable and relaxing holiday (although the shows on the territory of IC Green, which you can use for free, are very decent, certainly better than Rixos Belek, and the water park is amazing), for whom service is more important than red caviar (although the food here is also very tasty, but without oysters and caviar, of course). The many water slides and the children's pool there were also perfect, and every day it was a struggle in the late afternoon to go home for a shower ;-) Last but not least. Please note that only 2 of all the pools in the whole resort are heated (water park and indoor pool), I'm sure this is not a problem in summer but in April all the other pools were far too cold and were such a shame to have a pool villa with a pool that was too cold to use. The beach is sandy, wide, with a gradual increase in depth, the water is clean, fish swim, the beach is constantly cleaned. The territory is very beautiful, incredibly green - there is constant watering, landscape architects work, you are in an arboretum with aromas of pine needles and flowers. evening entertainment is nice and the water park for children is nice. * Large water park. As a guest at the Residence we also had access to the IC Green Palace and this was great for us as it allowed the kids to enjoy all the facilities such as the water park, beach, snack bars as well as kids clubs and evening theater performances (which by the way is hugely underrated!) . The fridge was filled with two bottles of water. The sand is course-type and full of rocks near the water's edge, so bring shoes. There are some water sports, but a bit expensive. Comment: Great resort for children and parents with a water park dedicated to all ages from 3 months to 16 years. the staff at the mini club, a fantastic staff, lots of activities | the children enjoyed being a stepmother (: | good and polite service | the children's areas are very clean and pleasant | great water park for both adults and children |.

The food looks very varied and tasty from a distance.

Comment: Everything is very good, the service and food are very successful, the sea is warm, the area where the villas are located is clean, it is enough to have a buggy service and the waiters and cooks do their best in terms of hygiene.

It is a shame that the internal Haman and wellness area is currently under renovation. The option of visiting the wellness area in IC Green Palace is not an option for us. Areas of development: *The villa was missing some room items that are usually there at this level of accommodation and we had to ask for them, like cotton buds, toothbrush. The food in the separate restaurant area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe residence was fantastic, a la carte in the morning to lunch in the evening, the service was excellent, hygiene and security measures were excellent. The season was almost over, so the hotel was tidy and relatively empty; There is a large area for children to play, and even care for the smallest children up to three years old. The benefits of the residence include things like access to the wonderful Mavi restaurant (large selection of food with a more refined elegance) and 24-hour bar, plunge pool, relaxation sauna and hammam area as well as a carriage on duty which has never been available. I would like to highlight the following staff: Abdurahma (I think he was there for all the guests) √ñmer (was always at the bar in the evening) Ufuk (always fresh cocktails at the beach bar every day) Mehmet (had control over everything in the beach area) Mustafa and Abdurahman were super friendly every night for dinner! 01 Huge green area.

We stayed in the Lake Deluxe room type, everything in the room is sufficient to meet all your needs, but the design of the room could be a little better Although it has been recently restored, it makes you feel like you are staying in an old place. I was hoping a place like this would hire more competent bartenders. Our bathtub was broken, the faucet on the sink was not properly installed, and the veneer on the facilities was chipped in many places. The parasols have just been replaced.

The many water slides and the children's pool there were also perfect, and every day it was a struggle in the late afternoon to go home for a shower ;-) Last but not least. There is a large selection of delicious food and drink for both children and adults. I do not recommend choosing a beach villa room category for families with children and those who like to go to bed early 64. Comment: We stayed at the complex with two families (four adults and four small children) for eight days. In addition, it was our express wish that our families (because of the small children) get these villas right next to each other. evening entertainment is nice and the water park for children is nice. The hotel complex is great for couples without children or for a holiday with friends. All very nice young couples, some with small children. There are great pools for children at IC Green Palace. *Pleasant children's club activities and entertainment facilities. The season was almost over, so the hotel was tidy and relatively empty; There is a large area for children to play, and even care for the smallest children up to three years old. The room layout is quite good in the Lake Villas, but the wardrobe layout in the so-called children's room is terribly poorly arranged. You are really well looked after and considering we had loud young children we were not once made to feel uncomfortable as they were very friendly and considerate of them too. There is always something to do with children, many activities, performances and competitions. Lots of imported drinks are included (you rarely see that in summer, but here in winter) Variety in food (always a selection of meat, fish, etc.) Children's menu and table incl. Heated pool + for children.

There is a beautiful beach at the resort, and the restaurants at both the Residence and Green Palace are fantastic. cleanest and most spacious beach! overall - a rare combination of a beach and a boutique hotel. We had lunch at the beach restaurant. The ones we remember best are the restaurant and beach guys Merve and Nihat, whose warm approach makes guests feel very welcome. The property has access to a private beach bar that serves food and drink, we made good use of this facility and the service was excellent here. The beach is a bit far away, if you wish, you can call a buggy and go. The beach is mixed with pebbles and sand, the sea is shallow, the edges are pebbles, but the inside of the sea is pure sand and it is very beautiful. Since there are not many guests, there is no one around, it is like a private beach for you. Unfortunately, a bartender or waiter I came across at the beach bar (I saw him later while serving food) couldn't make me one of them.

The beach is sandy, wide, with a gradual increase in depth, the water is clean, fish swim, the beach is constantly cleaned. Two towels each, but like sandpaper to use.

Comment: Everything is very good, the service and food are very successful, the sea is warm, the area where the villas are located is clean, it is enough to have a buggy service and the waiters and cooks do their best in terms of hygiene. See you again next year The food is great, the variety is great, the sea is fantastic. We loved the main restaurant IC Residence, in high season it is a must - quiet relaxing, never crowded, great service and menu. The beach is mixed with pebbles and sand, the sea is shallow, the edges are pebbles, but the inside of the sea is pure sand and it is very beautiful. I would like to note the excellent work of the staff of the seaside bar Omer - super professional, always with a smile even in the hellish heat, Alena, Tamila, chef Mehmet and colleagues - provide the highest level of service, thank you very much! there are 43 villas - even in the high season the territory is not crowded, the right level of silence is ensured, it is great that the animation is located on the territory of IC Green Palace, if you need activities, everything is there, and the Residence is quiet and calm. I recommend it to those who are tired of the noise of the big city and want greenery, sea and silence 63. The pools and sea were very clean and refreshing. In July it is high season and the hotel seems to be booked early from Russia; as initially I wanted a villa with a private pool, but all were booked. The season was almost over, so the hotel was tidy and relatively empty; There is a large area for children to play, and even care for the smallest children up to three years old. The staff are also very friendly and attentive and the service is so seamless at times you don't even notice. Comment: The place is beautiful, the sea is nearby, close to the airport, high quality service. Beautiful beach, clear sea.

Comment: Just back from a family vacation and felt the need to write a review. Our family traveling with us had a beautiful view over a staircase and also no direct access to the pool. At least on the fourth day of the holiday we managed to get at least the family we were traveling with to get a slightly better room (not a villa) with direct access to the pool. Comment: We have just spent a week as a family (4 people) from 03/04 to 10/04. Yorum: In my opinion, IC Residence Hotel is the best hotel in Turkey that my family, friends and I stayed at.

Comment: Very nice all-inclusive resort, and great for family holidays! Special thanks for preparing some extra dishes from the menu for the baby. Comment: Not suitable for baby 177. Comment: We went on vacation to this wonderful hotel with children (our children are of different ages), we are young parents, so we considered two territories that you can use at the highest level, these are the Green Palace Hotel nearby - there are many fun, ‚Ä¶ 12. We are traveling with 2 families with children (ages 7 and 10). The food was brilliant and the children enjoyed helping themselves to the ice creams. Comment: We relax in this hotel room 5015 with the whole family and 2 children. Comment: Perfect hotel to come with children. It is very practical with small children. Big thanks for the prams, with small children in hot times it was a big help! Comment: The holiday with the two small children was great all around: very warm welcome with champagne and non-alcoholic cocktail for the 3 year old, beautiful room with enough space for prams, sand toys etc. There is everything the children want. The main restaurant is great, good service and they make extra dishes for the grandchildren. Ideal for those with children as it is located next to the Green Palace which has many facilities for children including many water slides and features, a fantastic kids club with lots of activities every day and several pools. I would definitely recommend this hotel, especially for those with children who want a holiday that feels calm and peaceful but also has facilities to entertain the little ones. Comment: A beautiful hotel complex ideal for children and families. The service to order food to your room is very convenient (especially in the morning, when the parents are sleeping and the children want breakfast) and free))! What a wonderful place to do with children. The many water slides and the children's pool there were also perfect, and every day it was a struggle in the late afternoon to go home for a shower ;-) Last but not least. There is a large selection of delicious food and drink for both children and adults. I do not recommend choosing a beach villa room category for families with children and those who like to go to bed early 64. Comment: We stayed at the complex with two families (four adults and four small children) for eight days. In addition, it was our express wish that our families (because of the small children) get these villas right next to each other. evening entertainment is nice and the water park for children is nice. The hotel complex is great for couples without children or for a holiday with friends. All very nice young couples, some with small children. There are great pools for children at IC Green Palace. *Pleasant children's club activities and entertainment facilities. The season was almost over, so the hotel was tidy and relatively empty; There is a large area for children to play, and even care for the smallest children up to three years old. The room layout is quite good in the Lake Villas, but the wardrobe layout in the so-called children's room is terribly poorly arranged. You are really well looked after and considering we had loud young children we were not once made to feel uncomfortable as they were very friendly and considerate of them too. There is always something to do with children, many activities, performances and competitions. Lots of imported drinks are included (you rarely see that in summer, but here in winter) Variety in food (always a selection of meat, fish, etc.) Children's menu and table incl. Heated pool + for children. If I may just say, add a waiter to the beach restaurant because the 2 waitresses are a bit overwhelmed‚Ä¶ and I also think that the age of the children (over 10) for the slides is a bit exaggerated if they are accompanied by their parents because I want you to count on safety, but it has to be everywhere‚Ä¶ because there is no lifeguard at the swimming pool in the residence.. Comment: Great resort for children and parents with a water park dedicated to all ages from 3 months to 16 years. the staff at the mini club, a fantastic staff, lots of activities | the children enjoyed being a stepmother (: | good and polite service | the children's areas are very clean and pleasant | great water park for both adults and children |.

We stayed in a Bali Junior villa with private pool. |Private transportation to and from the airport.|The lakeside villa is great! A private restaurant, pools, attentive waiters, lots of greenery. Our choice of a beach villa was ideal ‚Äì it was beautifully maintained, offered a private pool for splashy fun, and even came with a dedicated cabana on the beach for ultimate relaxation.

Nice rooms with private pool with pool terrace and good cleaning every day and well-stocked minibar. The included private airport transfer was the extra to make the holiday a truly perfect holiday. We stayed in the 4 bedroom villa, the villa itself was a good size to accommodate but please note that one of the bedrooms does not have a private bathroom and it is not a shared bathroom so if you are traveling as a group some will not have a bathroom to use. The property has access to a private beach bar that serves food and drink, we made good use of this facility and the service was excellent here. Since there are not many guests, there is no one around, it is like a private beach for you. Our travel agent was to book 2 villas with a private shuttle from the airport and all the bells and whistles (cabanas, all inclusive plus, etc.). The private villa is a great retreat and very quiet. Everyone who books IC Residence also has private transport from the airport included. Surprise: we are met at the exit of the airport by a driver who takes us to the residences in a private shuttle bus (van type limousine).
